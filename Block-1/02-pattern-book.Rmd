***Mathematical modeling*** is a process where mathematics is used to understand, analyze, or predict a real-world situation. This process often occurs in cycles that revisit each of the following three stages: `r mark(200)`

1. Translate the real-world situation into a mathematical form (called a model)
2. Shape the model to answer the question at hand
3. Evaluate the model's reliability and agreement with the real-world situation

We'll discuss each stage of the modeling process in the following paragraphs and explore as a concrete example the way Sir Isaac Newton applied his theory of universal gravitation to the motion of planets.

The first stage of mathematical modeling involves **translating the real-world situation into a mathematical form**; the output or result of this stage is called a ***mathematical model***. **In this book** the objective of the translation phase will almost always be to choose or construct one or more  ***function***s that represent the relationships involved in the system being studied. You'll learn several strategies for turning what you know about the system into appropriate functions. And you'll learn some standard ***frameworks*** for organizing your ideas to help you determine how functions will be related, for instance Newton's framework relating position, velocity, and acceleration as rates of change of one another. `r mark(210)`

As a concrete example of this first stage, consider how Newton had to translate observations about planetary motion into a mathematical form. He was trying to make sense of the motion of planets in light of his novel theory that gravity is a universal force of attraction between *all* masses, rather than something peculiar to celestial bodies. He showed that the motions of planets, moons, and the Sun are governed by the same basic principles as an apple falling from a tree. To do this, he modeled force as a quantity that can be measured, simplified the complexity of the planets to mere masses (another measurable quantity), and supposed that position and motion were related.
<!-- [[Taken out. because it's unclear what is being said about velocity & acceleration in this context.]] ##: He assumed ***velocity***  (the rate of change of position with respect to time) and ***acceleration*** (the rate of change of velocity with respect to time). -->
His theory of the motion of planets was based on two fundamental mathematical models: First, 
$$F = ma\ \ \ \text{(Newton's Second Law)}$$ which relates force, mass, and acceleration. Second, the  
$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2}\ \ \ \text{(Law of Universal Gravitation)}$$
(sometimes called the inverse square law), which relates the mass of two objects ($m_1$ and $m_2$), and the distance between them to the force of gravitation. We'll get to the purpose of the $G$ in Chapter \@ref(dimensions), but for the moment, understand that this process of translating observations about planetary motion into a mathematical form is characteristic of the first stage of the modeling process.

The second stage of modeling involves doing mathematical work to **shape the model into a form that can directly answer the modeler's question of interest**. For instance, Newton knew from previous astronomical observations and Kepler's theorizing that planets' orbits are elliptical in shape that he needed to do some work on his two models in order to deduce the orbital shapes consistent with his Second Law and Universal Gravitation. 

**In this book** you'll learn to use several key tools for doing mathematical work on functions. We might as well name them now: ***differentiation***, ***anti-differentiation***, ***optimization***, and ***zero-finding***. These tools derive directly from Newton's work on planetary motion, but thankfully, we are not constrained to using the technology of his day in their application. Instead, we will leverage modern computers to make each tool easier to use. Your job is to learn enough about them that you will know when, how, and why to use each tool.

The third and final stage of mathematical modeling often involves **evaluating the model**. The goal is to determine how reliable is the model's answer and to see if the consequences of the model are consistent with what happens in the real world. The evaluation often leads to a re-assessment of the model and a return to stage 1 to improve things. The resulting loop is called the ***modeling cycle***. For example, it seems likely that Newton did not start out knowing that gravitation follows an inverse square law. Perhaps he went through several ***modeling cycles*** until he found the form that was consistent with Kepler's elliptical orbits.

**In this book** you'll learn techniques for comparing models to data and for making predictions from models that can be compared to observations. You'll also see examples of when the evaluation of a function suggests revisions that might improve the model.

## Pattern-book functions

In this section, we introduce the ***Pattern-book functions***--a short list of simple mathematical functions that provide a large majority of the tools for representing the real world as a mathematical object. 
Think of the items in this list as different actors, each of whom is skilled in portraying an archetypical character: hero, outlaw, lover, fool, comic. A play brings together different characters, costumes them, and relates them to one another through dialog or other means. All this is for the purpose of telling a story and providing insight into human relationships and emotions. `r mark(230)`

A mathematical model is a kind of story and a mathematical modeler a kind of playwright. She combines mathematical character types to tell a story about relationships. But there is only a handful of archetypal mathematical functions, the analog of the character actors in drama and comedy. In creating a mathematical model, you clothe the actors to suit the era and location and assemble them together in harmony or discord.

Costume designers and others do not start from nothing. There are reference guides that collect patterns which a designer can customize to the needs at hand. These reference guides are sometimes called "pattern books." (See Figure \@ref(fig:pattern-book) for an example.) 

```{r pattern-book, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A pattern book of theatrical costumes", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/theatrical-pattern-book.jpg"))
```

Similarly, we will start with a pattern set of functions that have been collected from generations of experience. To remind us of their role in modeling, we'll call these ***pattern-book functions***. These pattern-book functions are useful in describing diverse aspects of the real world and have simple calculus-related properties that make them relatively easy to deal with. There are just a handful pattern-book functions from which untold numbers of useful modeling functions can be constructed. Mastering calculus is in part a matter of becoming familiar with the mathematical connections among the pattern-book functions. (You'll see these in due time.) 

Here is a list of our pattern-book functions showing both a traditional notation and the R formula:

```{r child="pattern-book-list.Rmd"}
```
     
These functions are shown with a traditional formula notation to highlight the connections to the math you already studied, and $x$ is used as the input to these functions out of tradition.  `r mark(240)`


::: {.takenote  data-latex=""}
The list of pattern-book functions is short. You should memorize the names and be able easily to associate each name with the traditional notation.

Over the next several chapters, we will introduce several features of functions. These features include:

- monotonicity up or down
- concavity up or down
- horizontal asymptotes
- vertical asymptotes
- periodicity
- continuity

By the end of Block 1, you should be able to list all the basic pattern-book functions and describe the features relevant to each. `r mark(250)`
:::

These pattern-book functions are widely applicable. But nobody would confuse the pictures in a pattern book with costumes that are ready for wear. Each pattern must be tailored to fit the actor and customized to fit the theme, setting, and action of the story. `r mark(260)`

Similarly, the mathematical functions used in real-world applications---as opposed to the pattern-book functions---are adorned with ***parameters***. Parameters do the work of fitting the pattern to the units and dimensions of the input and output quantities. Continuing our analogy, if the pattern is for a sock, the parameter is the size needed to fit the foot. And just as there are different systems for sizing shirts, trousers, shoes, and so on, tradition has favored idioms for parameterizing the different kinds of pattern-book functions. We haven't yet introduced these idioms, but when we do in Chapter \@ref(params-intro) you are well advised to learn to interpret them at a glance.

::: {.why  data-latex=""}
There is universal agreement about the names of all of the pattern-book functions except for two: the gaussian and the logarithm.

The name "gaussian" is not descriptive; the graph of a gaussian function looks like a camel's hump, the curve of a bell, or a bump in the road. There are all sorts of bell-shaped functions that differ slightly in their origins and detailed shape. In this book, we may use the terms "hump", "bell", or "bump" to remind you of the basic shape, but the specific mathematical function we have in mind is called the ***gaussian function***, named after a tremendously influential mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). This function, first published in 1718 (before Gauss was born), has an important role throughout physical science, technology, and data science. In probability theory and the social sciences, the shape of the function is given the simple name "normal distribution"; it shows up in so many places to be considered utterly unsurprising and "normal."

The name "logarithm" is anything but descriptive. The name was coined by the inventor, John Napier (1550-1617), to emphasize the original purpose of his invention: to simplify the work of multiplication and exponentiation. The name comes from the Greek words *logos*, meaning "reasoning" or "reckoning," and *arithmos*, meaning "number." A catchy marketing term for the new invention, at least for those who speak Greek!

Although invented for the practical work of numerical calculation, the logarithm function has become central to mathematical theory as well as modern disciplines such as thermodynamics and information theory. The logarithm is key to the measurement of information and magnitude. As you know, there are units of information used particularly to describe the information storage capacity of computers: bits, bytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and so on. Very much in the way that there are different units for length (cm, meter, kilometer, inch, mile, ...), there are different units for information and magnitude. For almost everything that is measured, we speak of the "units" of measurement. For logarithms, instead of "units" by tradition another word is used: the ***base*** of the logarithm. The most common units outside of theoretical mathematics are base-2 ("***bit***") and base-10 ("***decade***"). But the unit that is most convenient in mathematical notation is "base e," where $e = 2.71828182845905...$. This is genuinely a good choice for the units of the logarithm, but that's hardly obvious to anyone encountering it for the first time. To make the choice more palatable, it's marketed as the "base of the natural logarithm." In this book, we'll be using this ***natural logarithm*** as our official pattern-book logarithm.

## The power-law family

Three of the pattern-book functions---$1/x$, $x$, $x^2$---actually belong to an infinite family called the ***power-law functions***.  The three shown above occur so often and are so closely related to the other pattern-book functions that they receive their own special names (inverse, proportional, and square) and place in our list; however, it is the *family* of power-law functions that form the more general pattern needed for modeling. 

Some other examples of power-law functions are $x^3, x^4, \ldots$ as well as $x^{1/2}$ (also written $\sqrt{x}$), $x^{1.36}$, and so on. Some of these also have special (albiet less frequently used) names, but *all* of the power-law functions can be written as $x^p$, where $x$ is the input and $p$ is a number. `r mark(290)`.

Within the power-law family, it is helpful to know and be able to differentiate between several overlapping groups:

1. The ***monomials***. These are power-law functions such as $m_0(x) \equiv x^0$, $m_1(x) \equiv x^1$, $m_2(x) \equiv x^2$, $\ldots$, $m_p(x) \equiv x^p$, $\ldots$, where $p$ is a whole number (i.e., a non-negative integer). Of course, $m_0()$ is exactly the same as the constant function, since $x^0 = 1$. Likewise, $m_1(x)$ is the same as the identity function since $x^1 = x$. As for the rest, they have just two general shapes: both arms up for even powers of $p$ (like in $x^2$, a parabola); one arm up and the other down for odd powers of $p$ (like in $x^3$, a cubic). 

```{r monomial-graphs, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="keep", warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Graphs of the monomial functions from order 2 to 5."}
dom <- domain(x=c(-1.25, 1.25))
slice_plot(x^2 ~ x, domain=dom) %>% gf_labs(title=expression(m[2](x) %==% x^2), x="input") %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0)
slice_plot(x^3 ~ x, domain=dom) %>% gf_labs(title=expression(m[3](x) %==% x^3), x="input") %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0)
slice_plot(x^4 ~ x, domain=dom) %>% gf_labs(title=expression(m[4](x) %==% x^4), x="input") %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0)
slice_plot(x^5 ~ x, domain=dom) %>% gf_labs(title=expression(m[5](x) %==% x^5), x="input") %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0)
```
2. The ***negative powers***. These are power-law functions where $p<0$, such as $f(x) \equiv x^{-1}$, $g(x) \equiv x^{-2}$, $h(x) \equiv x^{-1.5}$. For negative powers, the  size of the output is inversely proportional to the size of the input. In other words, when the input is large (**not** close to zero) the output is small, and when the input is small (close to zero), the output is *very* large. This behavior happens because a negative exponent like $x^{-2}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{x^2}$; the input is *inverted* and becomes the denominator, hence the term "inversely proportional".

```{r negative-graphs, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="keep", warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Graphs of power-law functions with negative exponents. Note that the function output is very large when $x$ is near zero."}
pos_domain <- function(p, max=200) {
  small <- max^(1/p)
  domain(x=c(!!small, 1.25))
}
neg_domain <- function(p, max=200) {
  res <- pos_domain(p, max)
  res$x <- -res$x
  res
}

slice_plot(x^-1 ~ x, domain=pos_domain(-1), npts=500) %>%
  slice_plot(x^-1 ~ x, domain=neg_domain(-1), npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title=expression(x^{-1})) %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0) %>%
  gf_lims(y=c(-200, 200))
slice_plot(x^-2 ~ x, domain=pos_domain(-2), npts=500) %>%
  slice_plot(x^-2 ~ x, domain=neg_domain(-2), npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title=expression(x^{-2})) %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0) %>%
  gf_lims(y=c(-200, 200))
slice_plot(x^-1.5 ~ x, domain=pos_domain(-1.5), npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title=expression(x^{-1.5})) %>%
  slice_plot(-x^2 ~ x, alpha=0) %>%
  gf_lims(y=c(-200, 200), x=c(-1.25,1.25))
```

3. The **non-integer powers**, e.g. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, $g(x) = x^\pi$, and so on. When $p$ is either a fraction or an irrational number (like $\pi$), the real-valued power-function $x^p$ can only take non-negative numbers as input. In other words, the domain of $x^p$ is $0$ to $\infty$ when $p$ is not an integer. You have likely already encountered this domain restriction when using the power law with $p=\frac{1}{2}$, since $f(x)\equiv x^{1/2}=\sqrt{x}$, and the square root of a negative number is not a *real* number. Some of you may have heard about the *imaginary* numbers that allow you to take the square root of a negative number, but for the moment, you only need to understand that when working with real-valued power-law functions with non-integer exponents, the input must be non-negative. (The story is actually a bit more complicated since, algebraically, rational exponents like $1/3$ or $1/5$ with an odd-valued denominator can be applied to negative numbers. Computer arithmetic, however, does not recognize these exceptions.)

```{r non-integer-graphs, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="keep", warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The domain of power-law functions with non-integer power is $0 \\leq x < \\infty$."}
dom <- domain(x=c(-1.25, 1.25))
slice_plot(x^(1/2) ~ x, domain=dom, npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title=expression(x^{1/2})) %>%
  slice_plot(-sqrt(x) ~ x, alpha=0)
slice_plot(x^pi ~ x, domain=dom, npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title=expression(x^{pi})) %>%
  slice_plot(-x^pi ~ x, alpha=0)
```

## Constructing functions

Often, modeling involves building a complicated function out of the simple shapes provided by the pattern-book functions. This is not yet the time to say much more, but we do want to show you what such a construction looks like in both a traditional style of notation and the style used for programming computers. As you'll see later, in Chapter \@ref(fun-assembling), to make complicated functions we generally combine simpler functions in one or more of three different ways: ***linear combinations***, ***products***, and ***composition***. `r mark(270)`

As a very brief introduction, consider these examples. A ***polynomial*** is a ***linear combination*** of simple functions called "monomials." These are likely familiar to you in traditional notation:
$$g(x) \equiv 2 + 3 x - 7x^2$$
In the R/mosaic computer notation we will be using the function $g()$ would be defined like this:
```{r}
g <- makeFun(2 + 3*x - 7*x^2 ~ x)
```

Notice that the R/mosaic notation has most elements in common with the traditional notation, but the order is somewhat different. 

::: {.takenote  data-latex=""}
- `g <-` means to give the function the **name** $g.$ (In this book, I usually write function names with a pair of parentheses as a suffix, e.g. $g(x).$ This reminds you that the name refers to a function. But the R name is simply `g`, even though I often write it as `g()` in the text.) The `<-` is called the ***assignment operator***, the instruction in R to give a name to an object. Here, the object will be the R function created by `makeFun()`.
- `2 + 3*x - 7*x^2` is the **formula** for the function, that is, the expression found on the right-hand side of $\equiv$ in the traditional notation.
- `~ x` is the part of the R/mosaic notation that says, "The name of the input will be `x`." In traditional notation, the name of the input is in parentheses following the name of the function $g\,{\mathbf{(x)}}$, but in R/mosaic notation, the two are in different places: the function name is to the left of the assignment operator (`<-`) and the name of the name of the input follows the tilde (`~`). 
- The formula and the name of the input are always related in the R/mosaic notation by what is called a ***tilde expression***. The formula is on the left-hand side of the tilde (<span style="font-size: 24pt; line-height: 0.7;">`~`</span>) and the argument name is on the right-hand side of the tilde. If there is more than one argument, all the names go on the right-hand side of the tilde expression, separated by `&`. (Some people prefer to use `+` as the separator. That's fine, but we use the `&` convention throughout this book.)
- `makeFun()` is the R/mosaic operator that takes the information contained in the tilde expression and turns it into an R function; it literally "makes an R function", hence the name, `makeFun()`.
:::


Functions constructed as a ***product*** of simple functions can look like this in tradition notation:
$$h(t) \equiv \sin(t) e^{-t}$$
and like this in computer notation:
```{r}
h <- makeFun(sin(t)*exp(-t) ~ t)
```

In function ***composition***, the output of one function is the input to a second function, as with $$H(t) \equiv \sin\left(e^{-t}\right)$$ or, in computer notation,
```{r}
H <- makeFun(sin(exp(-t)) ~ t)
```


## Function shapes

You are going to be building models by selecting an appropriate function or by putting functions together in various ways. This might remind you of Lego blocks. As you know, Legos come in different shapes: $6\times 2$, $4\times 2$, $2\times 2$, and so on. Similarly, each of the pattern-book functions has a distinctively shaped graph. Knowing the shapes by name will help you when you need to build a model. `r mark(280)`


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold", warning=FALSE}
dom <- domain(x=c(-1.25, 1.25))
slice_plot(exp(x) ~ x, domain=dom) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Exponential", x="input") %>%
  gf_lims(y=c(0, 3))
slice_plot(log(x) ~ x, domain=dom) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Logarithm", x="input")
slice_plot(sin(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-10,10)), npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Sinusoid", x="input")
slice_plot(dnorm(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-3,3))) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Gaussian", x="input")
slice_plot(pnorm(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-3,3))) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Sigmoid", x="input")
```

The ***proportional function*** and the ***constant function*** have extremely simple shapes. Note that the graph of a constant function is not just any line, but a line with zero slope. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold"}
dom <- domain(x=c(-1.25, 1.25))
slice_plot(x ~ x, domain=dom) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Proportional function", x="input")
slice_plot(1 ~ x, domain=dom) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Constant function", x="input") %>%
  gf_lims(y=c(0, 2))
```

It is tempting to deny that the constant function is a function. After all, the output does not depend on the input. Still, this situation arises frequently in modeling: you start out supposing that one quantity depends on another, but it sometimes turns out that it does not. Since functions are our way of representing relationships, it is helpful to have a function for the situation of "no relationship." The constant function does this job.

You may also notice the proportional function shown above does nothing to change the input; it simply returns as output the same value it received as input. For this reason, the proportional pattern-book function ($f(x)=x$) is sometimes called the ***identity function***. Later we will show how this simple pattern-book function can be endowed with parameters that form the basis of many change relationships.


::: {.observation}
Functions like `sin()`, `log()`, `pnorm()` are always referred to by name with parentheses enclosing the arguments. Other functions are traditionally written without a name, for instance, like $e^x$ or $1/x$. These two different conventions can lead to confusion. There is little that can be done to avoid that confusion, since the dual conventions appear throughout technical work. 

If absolute consistency of notation were the prime goal, we could have written this book in a style that gives a name to every pattern-book function writes it in the name/parentheses style. Something like this:

```{r}
reciprocal <- makeFun(1/t ~ t)
constant <- makeFun(1 ~ z)
square <- makeFun(x^2 ~ x)
```

These would be used in the ordinary way, for instance:
```{r}
reciprocal(7)
constant(123.67)
square(19)
```

Writing reciprocal($x$) instead of $1/x$ is long-winded, which is perhaps why you never see it. But when you see $1/x$ you should think of it as a function being applied to $x$ and not as a bit of arithmetic.

By the way ... I used different names for the inputs in these three functions just to remind the reader that, for functions with one input, the name has no significance. You just have to make sure to use the same name on the left- and right-hand sides of the tilde expression.
