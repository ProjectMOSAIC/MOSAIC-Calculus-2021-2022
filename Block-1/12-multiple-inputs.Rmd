We can use ***linear combination*** and ***function multiplication*** to build up custom functions from the basic modeling functions. Similarly, linear combination and function multiplication provide ways to construct functions of multiple inputs. `r mark(1400)` 

## f(x) times g(t)

For example, when a guitar string is at rest it forms a straight line connecting its two fixed ends: one set by finger pressure along the neck of the guitar and the other at the bridge near the center of the guitar body. When a guitar string is plucked, its oscillations follow a sinusoid pattern of **displacement**. With the right camera and lighting setup, we can see these oscillations in action:

For a string of length $L$, the string displacement is a function of position $x$ along the string and is a linear combination of functions of the form $$g_k(x) \equiv \sin(k \pi x /L)$$ where $k$ is an integer.  A few of these functions are graphed in Figure \@ref(fig:guitar-string-modes) with $k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=3$.

```{r guitar-string-modes, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Vibrational modes of a guitar string."}
slice_plot(sin(pi*x/100) ~ x, domain(x=c(0, 100)), 
           label_text = "k=1") %>% 
  slice_plot(sin(2* pi*x/100) ~ x, color="dodgerblue",
             label_text="k=2", label_x = 0.95) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3* pi*x/100) ~ x, color="green",
             label_text="k=3", label_x = 0.90) %>%
  gf_labs(x="", y="", title="Three modes of a guitar string.")
string_shape <- function(x, t) {
  sin(pi*x/100)*sin(pi*t) - 2*sin(2*pi*x/100)*sin(2*pi*t) - 1.5*sin(3*pi*x/100)*sin(3*pi*t)
}

slice_plot(
  string_shape(x, t=pi/2) ~ x,
  domain(x=c(0,100))
) %>%
  gf_labs(x="Position along string (%)", y="Side-to-side displacement (mm) ", title="A linear combination of the modes")
```

Shapes of the sort in Figure \@ref(fig:guitar-string-modes) are a stop-motion flash snapshot of the string. The string's shape also changes in time, so the string's displacement is a function of both $x$ and $t$. The displacement itself is a sinusoid whose time period depends on the length and tension of the string as well as the number of cycles of the spatial sine: 
$$g_k(x, t) \equiv \sin(\frac{k \pi}{L} x) \ \sin(\frac{k \pi}{P}t)$$ Figure \@ref(fig:string-motion) shows a few snapshots of the 1.5 cycle string at different moments in time, and the motion of the linear combination.`r mark(1410)` 

```{r string-motion, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="String position changes over time."}
slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.5) ~ x, 
           domain(x=c(0,100))) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.6) ~ x, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.7) ~ x, alpha = 0.25) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Shape at three different instants",
          x = "", y="Side-to-side displacement")
slice_plot(string_shape(x, .5) ~ x, domain(x=c(0,100))) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .525) ~ x, alpha = 0.7) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .55) ~ x, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .575) ~ x, alpha = 0.37) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .6) ~ x, alpha = 0.25) %>%
  gf_labs(y="Side-to-side displacement (mm)",
          x = "Position along string (%)",
          title="Linear combination of vibrating modes at different times.")
```

## Two-variable modeling polynomial

In Section \@ref(modeling-polynomial-1) we introduced the low-order polynomial, either $g_1(x) \equiv a_0 + a_1 x$ or $g_1(x) \equiv b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2$ as a general-purpose way of generating a function with a smoothly curved shape. The same applies in constructing simple functions of two variables. 

Almost always, you should use at least a first-order polynomial, which is:
$$h_1(x, y) \equiv a_0 + a_x x + a_y y$$
But there is an important extension of this, using what's called a ***bilinear term*** or, more evocatively in statistics, an ***interaction term***.  This is
$$h_2(x, y) \equiv \underbrace{b_0}_\text{intercept} + \underbrace{b_x\, x + b_y\, y}_\text{linear terms} + \underbrace{b_{xy}\,x\, y}_\text{bilinear term}$$

The bilinear term arises  in models of phenemona such as the spread of epidemics, the population dynamics of predator and prey animals, and the rates of chemical reactions. In each of these situations one thing is interacting with another: a predator killing a prey animal, an infective individual meeting a person susceptible to the disease, one chemical compound reacting with another. `r mark(1420)` 

Under certain circumstances, modelers include one or both ***quadratic terms***, as in 
$$h_3(x, y) \equiv c_0 + c_x\, x + c_y\, y + c_{xy}\,x\, y + \underbrace{c_{yy}\, y^2}_\text{quadratic in y}$$
The skilled modeler can often deduce which terms to include from basic facts about the system being modeled. We'll need some additional calculus concepts before we can explain this in a straightforward way.

In writing polynomials like $$h_1(x, y) \equiv a_0 + a_x x + a_y y$$ or $$h_3(x, y) \equiv c_0 + c_x x + c_y\ y + c_{xy} x\ y$$
we are using **letters** as subscripts on the coefficients. Think of $c_x$ as saying, "I am the coefficient on the $x$ term in the polynomial." Using this style lets us use different letters from the start of the alphabet for the names of coefficients in the different polynomials while still making it clear which term each coefficient is scaling.

We left function ***composition*** out of the list of ways to build multivariable functions out of simpler functions with a single input.  

For instance, consider the two functions $f(x)$ and $g(t)$. The composition $f(g(t))$ has only **one** input: $t$. Similarly, $g(f(x))$ has only one input: $x$.
