On a piece of paper, sketch out the functions corresponding to exercise 21-26. (A rough approximation  will do, so long as it captures the salient features of the function for answering the question. You don't need to draw in tick marks or tick labels, but  do label the horizontal axis "input" and the vertical axis "output.")

Explain why the curve drawn does or does not define a function. [You can do this by annotating your sketch, circling and labeling, for instance, problem areas that make the curve not a function.] Also, if it is a function, state the apparent domain and range.
