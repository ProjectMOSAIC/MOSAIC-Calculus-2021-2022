The Bargain Basement store wants to sell its goods quickly.  Consequently, they reduce each product's price $P$ by 5% per day. 

```{r CCV1-1, echo=FALSE}

askMC(
  prompt = "If a jacket costs $80 today, how much will it cost in $t$ days?",
    "$P = 80 - 5t$" = "Remember, 5 percent is exactly the same as 0.05",
    "$P = 80 - 4t$" = "Remember, 4 percent is exactly the same as 0.04",
    "$P = 80 - 0.05t$" = "This  would  be a decrease in  price by 5 cents every day.",
    "$P = 80 (0.05)^t$" = "Each day's price would  be  only 5% that of the previous day's price.",
    "+$P = 80 (0.95)^t$+" = ""
)
```

You'll need to open a sandbox for the next question.

You're on your own here! Remember, to raise a number to a power, you can use an expression like `0.95^7`.

```{r CCV1-2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "You decided that you like the $80 jacket, but you have a budget of only $60. How long should you wait before coming back to the Bargain Basement store.?",
    "3 days" = "On day 3 the price will be $0.95\\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 80$. That's above your budget.",
    "4 days" = "On day 4 the price will be $80 \\times 0.95^4$= $65.16. Too much!",
    "5 days" = "On day 5 the price will be $80 \\times 0.95^5$= $61.90. Close, but still higher than your budget.",
    "+6 days+" = "",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
