Consider this graph of the length of the day at different levels of latitude and different days of the year. [Source](File:Hours_of_daylight_vs_latitude_vs_day_of_year_with_tropical_and_polar_circles).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercises/Fun/www/Hours_of_daylight.png"))
```

First, orient yourself to the graph  and what the contours mean. Note the vertical lines indicating the days of the equinoxes and solstices.

```{r daily-digital-07-TF1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "True or False: There is a place on the equator when the day length is *exactly* 12 hours at some time of year.",
  "TRUE" = "If there were,  the horizontal (dashed) line denoting the equator would cross the 12-hour contour. It doesn't.",
  "+FALSE+" = "Since the dashed equator line no where overlaps with the 12-hour contour line, there is no time of year when the length  of  day on  the equator is exactly 12 hours. Presumably this is because daylight starts somewhat before the sun rises above the horizon and ends somewhat after the sun goes below the horizon.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE)
```

The word "equinox" comes from the Latin for "equal night."

```{r daily-digital-07-TF2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "True or False: To judge from the contour plot, on the equinox every latitude has a length of day somewhat longer than the length of night.",
  "+TRUE+",
  "FALSE" = "Note that neither of the lines for the March or September equinoxes cross the 12-hour length-of-day contour.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE)
```

```{r daily-digital-07-QA5, echo=FALSE}

askMC(
  prompt = "US Air Force Academy is at latitude 38.9983Â° N. Reading from the contour plot, roughly what is the length (in hours) of the *longest* day of the year?",
  choices = c(13,14,"+15+",16,17, 18, 19),
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
