Consider the road descent summarized by this sign ...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/truck-on-hill.png"))
```

The "grade" of road is defined to be rise-over-run. Since both rise and run have dimension $L$, the ratio is dimensionless. The grade in percent is 100 times rise-over-run. A 100% grade corresponds to a $45^\circ$ angle.


```{r rooster-blue-QA15, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Taking the \"run\" to be the 5 miles indicated on the sign, what's the \"rise\"? (You can find unit conversion data on the internet.)",
    "0.91 miles" = "Close, but 18% times 5 miles is 0.9 miles.",
    "+4752 feet+" = "",
    "1.5 km" = "This is 0.932 miles.",
    "292 rods" = "This is 0.9125 miles.",
    "7.36 furlongs" = "This is 0.92 miles.",
    "22.64 $\\sqrt{\\text{acre}}$" = "A square-root of an acre is an unconventional unit for length. One acre is 43560 ft$^2$, so the square root of an acre is 208.71 feet or 0.03953 miles. So 22.64 $\\sqrt{\\text{acre}}$ is 0.895 miles.",
  inline=FALSE
)
```

Since a vehicle's odometer measures distance along the road *surface* rather than along the horizontal "run," it's likely that the sign-makers had in mind 5 miles being the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle rather than the horizontal leg.

```{r rooster-blue-QA16, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Which of these expressions gives the horizontal run for a rise of $y$ miles?",
    "$\\sqrt{5 - y^2}$ ",
    "+$\\sqrt{25 - y^2}$+",
    "$\\sqrt{y^2 + 25}$",
    "$\\sqrt{y^2+5}$",
  inline=FALSE
)
```

```{r rooster-blue-QA17, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Given that the grade is 18% and that the length of the road surface is 5 miles, what is the \"rise\"?",
    "0.85 miles",
    "1.40 km",
    "+283.5 rods+", 
    "6.8 furlongs",
    "22.01 $\\sqrt{\\text{acre}}$",
  inline=FALSE
)
```
