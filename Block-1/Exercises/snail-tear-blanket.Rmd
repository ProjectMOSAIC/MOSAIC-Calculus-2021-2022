We will be working extensively with  the *change* in output value  of a function when the *input value changes*. 

- The change in the output value of a function $f()$ when the input changes from $x = a$ to $x = b$ is $$f(x=b) - f(x=a)$$ Notice that when we talk about the change from $x=a$ to $x=b$ we subtract $f(a)$ from  $f(b)$. That  change is sometimes called the **rise** in the value of the function.  Rise always compares (by subtraction) the two **output values** corresponding to two specific input values. Remember that $a$ and $b$ stand for  specific numbers. 

- Corresponding with  the idea of the  change in output being $f(b) - f(a)$ the  change in the input value to a function is $b - a$. This is often  called the  *run* in the value of the input.
