Consider the problem of finding a value of $x$ such that $cos(x) = x^2$. This is easy to do graphically: find the input where the graphs of $cos(x)$ and $x^2$ cross.

```{r echo=FALSE}
slice_plot(cos(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-1,1)), size=3, alpha = 0.25) %>%
  slice_plot(x^2 ~ x, color="magenta")
```
In a sandbox, create a function $h(x)$ that is zero when the equation is satisfied. Pass the tilde expression `h(x) ~ x` to the R/mosaic  `findZeros()` operator to find a precise numerical answer to the problem:

```{r eval=FALSE}
h <- makeFun( __define_your_h_function__ )
findZeros(h(x) ~ x)
```
