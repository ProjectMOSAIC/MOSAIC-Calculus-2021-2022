Section \@ref(using-the-rules) explains that in differentiating a linear combination of two functions, or a product of two functions, or one function composed with another, your first task is to identify the two functions $f()$ and $g()$ involved. Second, compute the derivative of each of those functions on its own: $\partial_x f(x)$ and $\partial_x g(x)$.

Carry out these two tasks for each of the combined functions shown in the table. (The first row has been done for you as an example.) 

Combination    | $f()$    | $g()$   | $\partial_x f()$  | $\partial_x g()$ 
---------------|----------|----------|-------------------|--------
$e^x \ln(x)$   | $\ln(x)$ | $e^x$ | $\recip$ (that is $1/x$) | $e^x$
$sin(e^x)$     |          |          |                   |           
$x + x^2$      |          |          |                   |           
$1/\sin(x)$    |          |          |                   |           
$\pnorm(x)^2$  |          |          |                   |           
$\sqrt{\pnorm(x)}$ |          |          |                   |           
$\pnorm(x^2)$  |          |          |                   |           
$pnorm(sin(x))$ |          |          |                   |
