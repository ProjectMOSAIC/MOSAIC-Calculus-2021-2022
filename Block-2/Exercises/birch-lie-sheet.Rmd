The Taylor polynomial for $e^x$ has an especially lovely formula: $$p(x) = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \cdots$$

```{r ctp1-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "In the above formula, the center $x_0$ does not appear. Why not?",
  "Having a center is not a requirement for a Taylor polynomial." = "This is wrong. All Taylor polynomials are expansions around some fixed center value.",
  "There is a center, $x_0 = 1$, but terms like $x_0 x^2$ were simplified to $x^2$." = "Look again at the Taylor formula at the start of this section. The basis functions are $x-x_0, (x-x_0)^2, \\ldots$, not $x_0 x, x_0 x^2, \\ldots$",
  "+There is a center, $x_0 = 0$, but the terms like $(x-x_0)^2$ were simplified to $x^2$.+"
)
```
