Consider the function $f(x) \equiv (x - 3)^2$.

```{r dfb1-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Using ordinary algebra, $f(x)$ can be expanded as $(x^2 - 6 x -9)$. Is $$p(x) = -9 - 6 x + x^2$$ a Taylor polynomial expansion of $f(x)$?",
  "+Yes, with a center at $x_0 = 0$+",
  "Yes, with a center at $x_0 = 3$",
  "No, because there are no factorials involved" = "The factorials are already built-in to the coefficients."
)
```
