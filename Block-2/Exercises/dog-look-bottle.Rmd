Confirm using algebraic manipulation the differentiation rule for a product of three functions:

$$\left[ u\cdot v\cdot w\right]' = \color{blue}{u'}\cdot v\cdot w\ +\ u\cdot \color{blue}{v'}\cdot w\ +\ u\cdot v\cdot \color{blue}{w}'$$
Here, $u$ is shorthand for $u(x)$, and $u'$ is shorthand for $\partial_x u(x)$, and similarly for $v$ and $w$.

Hint: $\left[ u\cdot v\cdot w\right] = u \cdot \left[ v \cdot w\right]$. So a product of three functions can be seen as a product $u\cdot h$ where $h \equiv v \cdot w$.
