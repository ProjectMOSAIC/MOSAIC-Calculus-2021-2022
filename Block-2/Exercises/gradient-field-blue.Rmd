Here is a contour plot of a function $g(x,y)$. You will be presented with several gradient fields. Your task is to determine whether the gradient field corresponds to the contour plot and, if not, say why not.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dom <- list(x=c(0, 3), y=c(0,3))
funs <- list()
funs[[1]] <- makeFun((x + y)^2 ~ x + y)
funs[[2]] <- makeFun(-(x + y)^2 ~ x + y)
funs[[3]] <- makeFun((x+y) ~ x + y)
funs[[4]] <- makeFun((x + 2*y ~ x + y))
contour_plot(funs[[1]](x, y) ~ x + y, dom, filled=FALSE, skip=0) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
```


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(102)
numbers <- sample(length(funs))
gp <- list()
for (k in 1:length(numbers)) {
  gp[[k]] <- gradient_plot(funs[[numbers[[k]]]](x, y) ~ x + y, dom, npts=10, alpha=1) %>%
    gf_labs(title = paste("Gradient field", k)) %>%
    gf_refine(coord_fixed()) %>%
    gf_lims(x=c(0,3), y=c(0,3))
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
gp[[1]]
```


```{r daily-digital-24-QW7, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's wrong with gradient field 1?",
    "arrows point down the hill instead of up it",
    "+magnitude of arrows are wrong, but direction is right+",
    "arrows don't point in the right direction",
    "nothing is wrong",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
gp[[2]]
```

```{r daily-digital-24-QW8, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's wrong with gradient field 2?",
    "+arrows point down the hill instead of up it+",
    "magnitude of arrows are wrong, but direction is right",
    "arrows don't point in the right direction",
    "nothing is wrong",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
gp[[3]]
```

```{r daily-digital-24-QW9, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's wrong with gradient field 3?",
    "arrows point down the hill instead of up it",
    "magnitude of arrows are wrong, but direction is right",
    "arrows don't point in the right direction",
    "+nothing is wrong+",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
gp[[4]]
```

```{r daily-digital-24-QW10, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's wrong with gradient field 4?",
    "arrows point down the hill instead of up it",
    "magnitude of arrows are wrong, but direction is right",
    "+arrows don't point in the right direction+",
    "nothing is wrong",
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE)
