On the computer (and in using data), you can set $h$ too small in the slope function. This will become obvious in the graph when $h$ is too small.  Start adding zeros in `sin(x, h=0.0001)` until you see the problem.

```{r h-too-small, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these values for `h` is the smallest you can go before the problems of too-small `h` start showing up?",
  "`h=0.00001`",
  "`h=0.00000001`",
  "+`h=0.00000000001`+",
  "`h=0.00000000000001`" = "Not a bad choice, but if you look closely you'll see little wobbles in the curve. That's the result of numerical round-off error in the computer calculations.",
  "`h=0.000000000000000001`",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
