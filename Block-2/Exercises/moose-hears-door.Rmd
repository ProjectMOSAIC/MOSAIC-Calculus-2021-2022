For the sketched functions below, decide what level of smoothness---$C^0, C^1, C^2, ...$--- best describes the function. (We make no tricks in the drawings. Where a function looks like it's broken--that is, the function locally has a V-shape or  a $\Lambda$-shape--it is meant to be broken.)




```{r daily-digital-26-QA1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's the smoothness level of function A(x)? (Hint: A quadratic function has a first derivative that changes with x  but a second derivative that is constant for all x.)",
  "discontinuous", "$C^0$", "+$C^1$+", "$C^2$ or higher",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/continuity-A.png"))
```
```{r daily-digital-26-QA2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's the smoothness level of function B(x)?",
  "+discontinuous+", "$C^0$", "$C^1$", "$C^2$ or higher",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/continuity-B.png"))
```

```{r daily-digital-26-QA3, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's the smoothness level of function C(x)?",
  "discontinuous", "+$C^0$+", "$C^1$", "$C^2$ or higher",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}

```{r daily-digital-26-QA4, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "What's the smoothness level of function D(x)?",
