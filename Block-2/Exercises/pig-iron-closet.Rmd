Here is a Taylor polynomial: 
$$p(x) = e + \frac{e}{1!} (x-1) + \frac{e}{2!} (x-1)^2 + \cdots$$

```{r pic1-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Where is the center $x_0$ of this polynomial?",
  "$x_0 = -2$", "$x_0 = -1$", "$x_0 = 0$", "+$x_0=1$+", "$x_0 = 2$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE )
```


```{r pic1-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Your roommate suggests that $p(x)$ is a Taylor expansion of $e^x$ around $x=1$. Is he right?",
  "No, a polynomial doesn't have functions like $e$." = "$e$ is not a function, it's just a number, 2.718282....",
  "+Yes. The center is $x_0 = 1$.+",
  "Not really. The formula suggests that the center is $x_0=1$ but the coefficients are wrong." = "The coefficients are right."
)
```
