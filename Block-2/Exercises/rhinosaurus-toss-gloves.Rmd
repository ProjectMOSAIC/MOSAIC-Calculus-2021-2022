**This was part of last year's unit on l'Hopital's rule.** Maybe not appropriate given our focus this year.

```{r zoz1-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Using the sandbox above, add more zeros to $x$ to make it even smaller. You can stop when you get tired. Does $\\sin(x)/x$ evaluate to something sensible for such tiny $x$? If so, what value?",
  "0", 
  "1/2",
  "+1+",
  "answer varies with $x$ as $x$ gets smaller",
  random_answer_order=FALSE
)
```

Saying, "so small that I got tired typing the zeros" is not a convincing
definition of "small" to a mathematician. For example,
0.0000000000000001 parsec (a unit of length) seems small but it is
equivalent to about 10 feet---no so small. Mathematicians want you to
take "small" to the limit, an arbitrarily large number of zeros, and
when you're done with that, even more zeros.

Fortunately, R and other computer languages have a scientific notation
that allows you just to name the number of zeros you want after the
decimal point. For instance `1e-2` is $0.01$---one zero. Similarly
`1e-20` is $0.00000000000000000001$, nineteen zeros.

```{r zoz1-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Use the previous sandbox, but this time use scientific notation so that you can look at $x$ as small as 1e-31 (30 zeros) or even smaller. Starting at `x = 1e-31`, calculate `sin(x)/x`.

How many zeros are there in the `x` that produces `NaN` as the answer to `sin(x)/x`?",

What's happening here has more to do with the nature of computers than
the nature of numbers. Computers (in the manner they are ordinarily
programmed) use packets of bits to represent numbers, and the chips have
been engineered to make those bit packets respond to arithmetic
operations as if they were the numbers they represent. A typical
computer number, like 0.001, uses 64 bits in a special, standard format.
Since there is a finite number of bits, there is a largest possible
non-`Inf` number and a smallest possible non-zero number. According to
the IEEE standard for "floating-point" arithmetic the largest non-`Inf`
number is around `1e300` and the smallest non-zero number is around
`1e-320`. This failure to behave like genuine mathematical numbers is
called "overflow" (for large numbers which turn into `Inf`) and
"underflow" (for small numbers which turn into `0`).

```{r zoz1-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Play around with numbers in the format `1e300`, `1e301` and so on until you find the smallest `1e???` that prints as `Inf`. Similarly, try numbers in the format `1e-320` and `1e-321` until you find the largest one that prints out as exactly zero. What are those two numbers?",
  "`1e305` and `1e-322`",
  "`1e306` and `1e-323`",
  "+`1e308` and `1e-324`+",
  "`1e309` and `1e-327`",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

The polynomial computer doesn't have any problem with overflow or
underflow. The key to success is to write the Taylor polynomial for
functions such as $\sin(x)$ or $x$ or $x^2$ near $x_0 = 0$. Such
polynomials will always look like:

$$f(x) = a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots$$

What's special here is that the `a_0` term does not need to be included
in the polynomial, since $f(0) = 0$.

```{r zoz1-5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "One of these functions has a Taylor polynomial at $x_0 = 0$ the *does need* a non-zero $a_0$ term. The other's don't. Which function needs the non-zero $a_0$ term?",
  "`sin()`",
  "`tan()`",
  "`atan()`",
  "+`acos()`+"
)
```

These zero divided by zero problems (like $\sin(x) / x$) always involve
a ratio of two functions ($\sin(x)$ and $x$ here) that don't need the
$a_0$ term in their Taylor series around $x_0 = 0$. That makes them just
a little bit simpler.

What's more important than simpler is that, for the expansion of such
functions to study the limit at $x \rightarrow 0$, we only need the
**first terms with a non-zero coefficient** $a_k$ to represent the
function with complete accuracy.

Why? Consider the 2nd-order Taylor polynomial $a_1 x + a_2 x^2$. If we
are to be able to safely disregard the $a_2$ term it is because that
term, for small $x$ is much, much smaller than the $a_1 x$ term. And we
can always choose non-zero $x$ to make this so.

For instance, suppose our polynomial were $x + 100 x^2$. For $x=0.1$,
the first and second terms are the same size; we need them both for
accuracy. For $x=0.01$, the second term is 1/100 the size of the first
term, maybe we don't need the second term so much. You can always make
$x$ so small that anyone will be satisfied that the second term is
utterly negligible compared to the first.

Here's the method:

Suppose you have a function $f(x) \equiv u(x)/v(x)$ where
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} u(x) = 0\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} v(x) = 0$$
Given this, $f(0)$ is not defined. But we can ask whether there is a
sensible value that can be plugged in in place of $f(0)$ that will cause
the modified $f()$ to be continuous at $x=0$.

Step 1: Write the Taylor polynomial expansion around $x-0 = 0$ for both
$u(x)$ and $v(x)$. If both expansions have a non-zero first coefficient,
you can stop there. Now we have:

$$u(x) \approx a_1 x$$
$$v(x) \approx b_1 x$$ where $a_1 = \partial_x u(0)$ and
$b_1 = \partial_x v(0)$.

Step 2: Divide the polynomial (really just linear!) expansion of $u()$
by the expansion of $v()$ to get

$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{u(x)}{v(x)} = \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{a_1 x}{b_1 x} = \frac{a_1}{b_1}$$

That's the answer, $a_1/b_1$, at least when $b_1 \neq 0$. We'll come
back to that case later.

```{r zoz1-6, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "For $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\sin(x) / x$, what are $a_1$ and $b_1$?",
  "+$a_1 = 1$ and $b_1 = 1$+",
  "$a_1 = \\pi$ and $b_1 = \\pi$",
  "$a_1 = -1$ and $b_1 = -1$",
  "$a_1 = 0$ and $b_1 = -1$"
)
```

Sometimes the singularity is at some non-zero $x$. For instance,
$$h(x) \equiv \frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 4}$$ The divide-by-zero comes into
play when $x=4$. So is there a sensible value to plug in for $h(4)$ to
replace the singularity.

Here, write your Taylor polynomials around $x_0 = 4$, the location of
the singularity. We'll get:

$$x^2 - 16 = a_1 (x-4) + a_2 (x-4)^2 + \cdots$$ 
$$x - 4 = b_1 (x-4)$$ Using Taylor's formula for coefficients we'll get
$$a_1 = \partial_x (x^2 - 16)\left.\right|_{x=4} = 2x\left.\right|_{x=4} = 8$$
$$b_1 = \partial_x (x - 4) = 1$$

Consequently, $\lim_{x\rightarrow 4} \frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 4} = 8$

We've been discussing ratios of functions where the ratio cannot be
calculated at the singularity using simply the limits of the functions
approaching that singularity. (For instance
$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \sin(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} x = 0$,
but knowing this does not tell us what
$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ will be. These are called
"indeterminate forms." As you've seen, if we know more about the
functions than merely their individual limits, we can sometimes resolve
the indeterminacy. Here we're doing that by writing each function as a
low-order polynomial.

The indeterminate form $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ might
be said to have the "shape" 0/0. But 0/0 is just a notation about the
limits of the two individual functions. There are indeterminate forms
with other shapes:
$$\frac{0}{0}\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{\infty}{\infty}\ \ \ \ \ \ 0\cdot {\infty\ \ \ \  \ 0^0\ \ \ \ \ \ \infty^0\ \ \ \ \ \ 1^\infty\ \ \ \ \ \ \infty - \infty}$$
Keep in mind that something like $0 \infty$ is not a multiplication
problem but rather shorthand for $u(x) v(x)$ where
$\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0} u(x) = 0$ and
$\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0} v(x) \rightarrow \infty$.

There is a variety of algebraic tricks to try to transform these
different shapes of indeterminate forms into a ratio of functions, each
of which goes to zero at the relevant $x_0$. Once that's done, you can
apply the method described above.

Indeterminate forms have been a bonanza for the author of calculus book
exercises, who can write an large number of examples, many of which have
never been seen in the wild.

One shortcut that that works in practice is to make a graph of the
indeterminate form near the singularity. If the limit as $x$ approaches
the singularity is a finite number, you can read off the result from the
graph.

In the sandbox below, the function $g(x)\equiv x \ln(x)$ is set up. This
function has a singularity at $x=0$. Examine the plot and determine
where the function value is going as you walk along the graph to the
singularity.
