Consider the function $f(x)  \equiv  \frac{x-3}{x-3}$. Simple algebra suggests that  the  output will be 1 for any $x$ value input, but the rules are division mean that the output is undefined for input $x=3$. We say,  the  function has a "singularity" at $x=3$. We want to test whether this singularity is removable, that is, whether  the function has  a  limit as $x \rightarrow 3$. The computer can help us out.  The basic idea is to try inputs closer  and closer to $x=3$  and see if the output behaves nicely. To help you distinguish between removable and  non-removable singularities (or, in the words of the song "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", to know "who's naughty or nice"), the sandbox defines the function $f()$ and  a similar function $g()$. Try out both $f()$ and $g()$ for a sequence of inputs that get closer and closer to $x=3$ but are not *exactly*  3.
