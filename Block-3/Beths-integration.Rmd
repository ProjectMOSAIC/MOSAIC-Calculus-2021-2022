# Beth's guide to Integration by Parts

## Where the formula comes from

$\partial(u \cdot v) = \partial u \cdot v + u \cdot \partial v$

## How to use the formula

$$\underbrace{\int x \cos(x) dx}_{\int u dv} $$

1. Pick $u$ (easy to differentiate)
2. Pick $v$ (easy to anti-differentiate)

So we'll chose $u = x$ and $dv = \cos(x) dx$

Giving $du = dx$ and $v = \sin(x)$
