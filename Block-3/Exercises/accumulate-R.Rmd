Copy the `accumulate()` function from Section \@ref(using-cumsum) into a `r sandbox_link()` and make the following plot:
```{r results="hide"}
Pts <- accumulate(dnorm(t) ~ t, t_0=-1, t_end=3, h=0.01)
gf_point(euler ~ t, data = Pts) %>%
  slice_plot(pnorm(t) ~ t, color="orange3")
```
There is a vertical difference between the accumulated points and `pnorm()`.

```{r accum-R-78-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What happens to this vertical difference if you make $t_0$ smaller (more negative) than $-1$?",
  "+The difference gets smaller.+",
  "The difference gets bigger.",
  "The difference stays the same.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
