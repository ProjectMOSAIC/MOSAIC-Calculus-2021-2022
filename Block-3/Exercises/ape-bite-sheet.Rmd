The graphic, from *[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210710_BRC783.png)* news magazine, shows the number of elective treatments (e.g. minor surgery, etc.) by the British National Health Service over the period January 2019 to April 2021. The point of the graph is to show the extent to which people avoided medical treatment due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which started to become severe in March 2020. (The January/February treatment numbers for 2020 line up pretty exactly with the 2019 numbers.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("www/NHS.png")
```

```{r absu-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC("According to the graphic, how many fewer treatements were there in the 12 months of 2020 compared to the 12 months of 2019? (Choose the best of the following answers.)", 
      "About 500,000" = "On average, the 2019 and 2020 curves are about 500,000 cases apart, but that's not the \"area\" between the two curves.",
      "About 2,000,000",
      "+About 6,000,000+" = "This is roughly the \"area\" between the two curves.",
      "About 10,000,000",
      random_answer_order=FALSE
)
```
