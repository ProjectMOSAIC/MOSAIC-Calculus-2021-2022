The following exercises are based on properties of definite integrals that were discussed in class and can be found on page 621 of the MMAC textbook.

Here are some definite integrals for which, without stating anything more about the function, we give you the numerical result. 


    |    
---------------------------|-------------------------------
$\int_{2}^{7} f(x) \,dx = -8$ | $\int_{-6}^{-2} g(x) \,dx = 3$
$\int_{2}^{12} f(x) \,dx = -14$ | $\int_{0}^{2} g(x) \,dx = 1$
$\int_{2}^{7} h(x) \,dx = 5$ | $\int_{0}^{2} h(x) \,dx = 6$


Use the above information to answer the multiple-choice questions below.



```{r antid-1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{2}^{7} 3f(x) \\,dx =$ ",
  "-8" = "Did you see the three?",
  "-42" = "Check the bounds",
  "+-24+",
  "13"
)
```

```{r antid-2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{7}^{12} f(x) \\,dx =$ ",
  "6" = "Be careful with your signs",
  "22" = " Be careful with your signs ",
  "+-6+",
  "-22" = " Be careful with your signs "
)
```

```{r antid-3, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{2}^{7} f(x) + g(x) \\,dx =$",
  "-3" = "Do you know $\\int_{2}^{7} g(x) \\,dx$?",
  "8" = "Do you know $\\int_{2}^{7} g(x) \\,dx$?",
  "-8" = "Do you know $\\int_{2}^{7} g(x) \\,dx$?",
  "+insufficient information to answer question+"
)
```


```{r antid-4, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{2}^{2} r(x) \\,dx =$ ",
  "-3" = "Look at the bounds",
  "+0+" = "Even though you don’t know $r(x)$ this is always true when the bounds are the same",
  "-8" = "Look at the bounds",
  "insufficient information to answer question at t"= "Look at the bounds"
)
```



```{r antid-5, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{-6}^{-2} g(x)+3 \\,dx =$ ",
  "6" = "You need to integrate the 3",
  "+15+",
  "12" = "Don’t forget g(x)",
  "3"= "Break it up into two different integrals"
)
```



```{r antid-6, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "$\\int_{12}^{7} f(x) \\,dx =$ ",
  "-6" = "Be careful with your signs",
  "22" = " Be careful with your signs ",
  "+6+",
  "-22" = " Be careful with your signs "
)
