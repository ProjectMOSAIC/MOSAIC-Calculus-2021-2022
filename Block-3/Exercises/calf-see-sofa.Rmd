Turkey has suffered inflation near 20%/year over the last few years, as shown by this graphic from *[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210710_EUC775.png)* news magazine. Note the "inverted scale" of the graph, which simply means it has been flipped top for bottom. This was done to convey correctly that the Turkish unit of currency, the lira, has been decreasing in value over the last 10 years, meaning that one US dollar can buy increasing amounts of lira. Other than this up-down flipping, the vertical scale is a normal, linear scale.
