Here are several functions that are related by differentiation and integration:

a. $\frac{1}{a} e^{ax + b}$
b. $a^2 e^{a x + b}$
c. $\frac{1}{a^2} e^{ax + b}$
d. $e^{ax + b}$
e. $a e^{ax + b}$

```{r chain1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt = "Which is the correct order of the functions so that the derivative of each function is to the left and the anti-derivative to the right?",
  "+BEDAC+",
  "BDECA" = "$\\frac{1}{a^2} e^{a x + b}$ is the anti-derivative of $\\frac{1}{a} e^{ax + b}$.",
  "BDCEA" = "Hint: The multipliers (e.g. $a^2$ or $\\frac{1}{a^2}$) should be in a particular, simple sequence.",

Here are several functions that are related by differentiation and integration:

a. $-\cos(x)$
b. $\cos(x)$
c. $\sin(x)$
d. $-\sin(x)$
