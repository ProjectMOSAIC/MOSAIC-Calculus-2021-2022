Consider this sequence: 4, 5, 3, 1, 2

```{r cumsum5-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the sum?",
  "14",
  "+15+" = "Yes, we know you can add. We just wanted you to keep in mind what the sum is for the next question, which is just about as easy.",
  "16",
  "17"
)
```

```{r cumsum5-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the cumulative sum?",
  "+The sequence 4, 9, 12, 13, 15+",
  "The sequence 2, 3, 6, 11, 15" = "That's backwards!",
  "The sequence 0, 4, 9, 13, 15" = "The first number in the original sequence is 4, so the cumulative sum will start with that."
)
```

```{r cumsum5-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which entry in the cumulative sum matches the sum?",
  "The first",
  "+The last+",
  "None of them",
  "All of them",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
