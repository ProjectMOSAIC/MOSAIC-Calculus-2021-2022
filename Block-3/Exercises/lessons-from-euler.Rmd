Some things to learn from the Euler Method:

1. Anti-differentiation is no more than *accumulating* the $f(x)$, after multiplying it by an appropriate step size $h$.

2. Since $h$ has the same dimension as the input $x$, the dimension of the anti-derivative will be [$f(x)$][$h$].

In our description of the Euler method, we made the assumption that when integrating $f(x)$ over the domain $a \leq x \leq b$, we can set $F(a) = 0$.  There's nothing fatal about this assumption, but we should admit that we could have used any value we like for $F(a)$. Using a non-zero value of $F(a)$ would simply add the same number to every point in the output of the Euler Method.

3. Any chosen number for $F(a)$ generates an authentic, genuine anti-derivative of $f(x)$. Since $F(a)$ can be any number at all, there are infinitely many anti-derivatives of any function $f(x)$. They all have the same shape, but differ from one another by a constant.

This constant, which amounts to the choice of $F(a)$, is called the "constant of integration." In many modeling tasks involving anti-differentiation, we need to find a choice for the "constant of integration" (that is, $F(a)$) that fits with what else we know about the system being modeled.
