Using whatever computational tool you like, find the numerical value of this definite integral.

$$\int^{5}_{2} x^{1.5} dx$$

Recall that for a definite integral of function $f()$, you find the anti-derivative $F(x) \equiv \int f(x) dx$ and evaluate it at the limits of integration. Here that will be $F(5) - F(2)$.




Solution
```{r pony-tbf1-solution}
f <- antiD( x^1.5 ~ x )
f(5) - f(2)
```
