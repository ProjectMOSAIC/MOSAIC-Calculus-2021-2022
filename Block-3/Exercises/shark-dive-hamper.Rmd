```{r usb6, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "Which of these candidates for $f()$ and $g()$ will produce  $$f(g(x))\\, \\partial_x g(x) = x^3 \\cos(x^4)\\ ?$$",
  "+$f(x) = \\cos(x)/4$ and $g(x) = x^4$+" = "The 1/4 cancels out the 4 produced by $\\partial_x g(x)$.",
  "$f(x) = \\cos(x)$ and $g(x) = x^4$",
  "$f(x) = x^4$ and $g(x) = \\cos(x)$" = "But $h(x)$ involves $\\cos(x^4)$ not $cos^4(x)$."
)
```


Once again, $\int h(x) dx = F(g(x))$, where $\partial_x F(x) = f(x)$.
