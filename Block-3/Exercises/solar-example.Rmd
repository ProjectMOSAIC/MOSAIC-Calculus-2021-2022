Your house has solar panels on the roof. In sunshine, these generate power. You use some of that power immediately for cooking, lighting, and such. Any power generated above your needs gets stored in a battery. Any power used above the solar generation gets supplied by the battery.

Over the course of a day, your use of power fluctuates (you use the toaster, open the refrigerator, etc). Similarly, the solar generation fluctuates as clouds pass by and the sun rises and sets in the sky. The amount of energy stored in the battery fluctuates over the day as you consume energy in your home and produce it with the solar panels. 

The unit used for electrical power is a "kilowatt" (kW). An old-fashioned incandescent light bulb consumes about 0.1 kW while lighted, a modern LED bulb generates about the same amount of light using only 0.01 kW. A refrigerator uses about 0.1 kW while a hair-dryer uses about 1 kW when it is running.

Batteries store energy. The usual unit for energy is "kilowatt-hour" (kWh). A refrigerator will, over a 24-hour day, use 0.1 * 24 = 2.4 kWh. Power multiplied by time duration gives energy. If the power were constant, the energy could be calculated by a simple multiplication of the power over the duration. Since power fluctuates, we can't do the calculation with ordinary multiplication. Instead, we have to integrate power over time.

The graphs show the situation over the course of a single day.The top graph shows net power produced as a function of time of day. The bottom graph shows net energy accumulated in the battery since 00:00.  

Since you are obsessed with your solar system, you have installed an app on your phone. It beeps each time the stored energy in the battery changes by one kW-minute (that is 1/60 of a kWh). The beeps are recorded in the middle graph. The beeps have a low, sad tone when the energy stored is falling (shown as a red line). The beeps have a high, happy tone when the energy stored is rising (shown as a black line). 

Note that by click-dragging the mouse over the beep graph---the one in the middle---you can highlight an interval of time. The top and bottom graphs will then show the information corresponding to the beeps during that interval.
