The equation below shows three items, all of which are equivalent even though they look different. You can see this from the equal signs separating the three items.

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/three-perspectives.png"))
```

REPLACE WITH COLORIZED VERSION

$$\large \int_{a}^{b} {f(x)} dx = {F(x)}\left.\right|_{a}^{b} = {F({b})} -{F({a})}$$
<!--
$$\large \int_\color{magenta}{a}^\color{magenta}{b} \color{blue}{f(x)} dx = \color{blue}{F(x)}\left.\right|_\color{brown}{a}^\color{magenta}{b} = \color{blue}{F(\color{magenta}{b})} -\color{blue}{F(\color{magenta}{a})}$$

-->
When you reach the point where you can say, "That's obvious," and can write down the three items from memory, you will have achieved an important facility with calculus.

```{r 3persp1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Since the three items are equivalent, they are all the same kind of \"thing.\" What kind of thing are they?",
  "+a number+" = "Another term for this is *definite integral*. Evaluating an anti-derivative at two values of $x$ and subtracting one from the other gives a number. (Remember, in our notation, $a$ and $b$ stand for numerical constants, unless we specifically say otherwise.)",
  "a function of $x$" = "Each of the items include something that is a function of $x$, but the entire item is not itself a function of $x$.",
  "an interval" = "Each of the items includes an interval, but the entire item is not one.",
  "a limit of integration" = "Each of the items includes a limit of integration, but the entire item is not one.",
  "an anti-derivative" = "There is an anti-derivative involved in each item, but the entire item is not one.",
  "a constant of integration" = "No constant of integration is needed to express any of the items" 
)
```

The equation has been [written in color](https://betterexplained.com/articles/colorized-math-equations/) to help you identify elements that are the same in each of the three items. 

```{r 3persp2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of the colors stands for *a limit of integration*?",
  "black", "dodgerblue", "tan", "orange3",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  right_one = "tan"
)
```

```{r 3persp3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of the colors stands for *the derivative of a function that appears elsewhere in the equation*?",
  "black", "dodgerblue", "tan", "orange3",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  right_one = "orange3"
)
```

```{r 3persp4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of the colors stands for *an anti-derivative of a function that appears elsewhere in the equation*?",
  "black", "dodgerblue", "tan", "orange3",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  right_one = "dodgerblue"
)
```
