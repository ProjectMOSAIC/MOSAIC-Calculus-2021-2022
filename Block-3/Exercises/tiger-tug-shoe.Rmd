In this activity, you are going to use the "Graph-antiD" web app which enables you to visualize the anti-derivative function in terms of areas. To use the app, click-drag-and-release to mark part of the domain of the function being displayed. 

::: {.todo}
Add a picture of the app and a link to it.

To answer these questions correctly, **you must set the "Shape of function" box to 864**.
