The (so-called) "First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" says:

$$\partial_t \int_a^t f(x) dx \ = \ f(t)$$

```{r fft2-2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
"Consider this new quantity:  $$\\partial_t \\int_t^a f(x) dx$$ Which of the following is a valid simplification of the quantity?",
  "$f(t)$",
  "$f(-t)$",
  "+$-f(t)$+",
  "none of the above",
random_answer_order = FALSE)
```
