# Constraints and optimization

EXAMPLE FROM CHAPTER 25

Previously, in Section \@ref(partial-thinking), we constructed a model of the effectiveness and tutoring on exam performance.

```{r zero-one, fig.cap="The model constructed in Chapter 25 for exam performance $P$ as a function of studying $S$ and tutoring $T$."}
P <- makeFun(0.5*S + 0.5*T + 0.5*S*T - 0.5*S^2 ~ S & T)
contour_plot(P(S, T) ~ S & T, domain(S=0:1, T=0:1))
```

There are only so many hours in the day. There's a constraint on the amount of time you have to study and to be tutored. A very basic model of this constraint is $S + T = 1$. Since there are no units attached to $S$ and $T$ in the graph, we can't be sure that the slope of the constraint is really $-1$, but we know it will be negative. What are the implications of this constraint in terms of optimal choices for $S$ and $T$. [That you do some of each, not all of one and none of the other.]
