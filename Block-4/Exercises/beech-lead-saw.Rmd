`r under_construction()`

Find the energy needed to lift the 1kg object in the example to 20,000 km from the Earth's surface. [They will need to do the computing. Hand in the R statement that you used. Recall that you can write scientific notation using the computer `e` syntax, e.g. $6.47\times 10^6 =$ `6.47e6`.]
