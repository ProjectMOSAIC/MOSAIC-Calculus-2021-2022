In Figure \@ref(fig:uniform-density), give quantitatively plausible estimates for the parameters $a$ and $b$. You may not be able to say everything about $a$ and $b$, but you should be able to say something and do so precisely and accurately.

<!-- it must be that $b - a = 1.5$. We can't say anything about $a$ or $b$ individually, just about their difference. -->
