A) Write a Newton-step `better()` function to solve for $x$ in the equation $\sin(x) = \cos(x)$. Start with the guess $x_0 = 0$ and iterate `better()` enough times to get $\| x_i - x^\star\| < 0.001$.

To help, we'll give the hint that $x^\star \approx 0.785$.

B) Suppose we hadn't told you the answer $x^\star$. How could you know, just from your iterations of `better()`, that you are very close to the true answer.
