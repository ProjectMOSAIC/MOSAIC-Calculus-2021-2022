The two graphs below show the same set of knot points. The interpolating function in each graph is either a quadratic or a cubic spline.
```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1048)
Pts <- tibble(x=cumsum(c(1, runif(4), .8)), y = rnorm(length(x)))
fone<- qspliner(y ~ x, data = Pts, free=1)
ftwo <- qspliner(y ~ x, data = Pts, free=-1)
P1 <- slice_plot(fone(x) ~ x, domain(x=range(Pts$x))) %>%
  gf_point(y ~ x, data = Pts, color="orange", size=3, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Function A")
P2 <- slice_plot(ftwo(x) ~ x, domain(x=range(Pts$x))) %>%
  gf_point(y ~ x, data = Pts, color="orange", size=3, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Function B")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)
```

1. There are three possibilities: both function A and function B are quadratic splines, both functions are cubic splines, or one is a quadratic and the other a cubic spline. Which of these is the case in the above graphs?
2. Explain what led you to your conclusion.
