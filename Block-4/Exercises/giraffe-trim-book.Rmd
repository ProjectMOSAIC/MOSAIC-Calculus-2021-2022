In a BÃ©zier spline, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ can be interpreted as the $(x,y)$ coordinate at time $t$ of a pen on the drawing canvas. Let's take that interpretation literally and figure out some features of the pen's motion. it's reasonable to think about the pen in physical terms.

The $x$-component of the pen as a function of time $t$ is $$x(t) = (1-t)^3\, x_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\, x_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\, x_3 + t^3\, x_4$$ where the domain is $0 \leq t \leq 1$.

In terms of the coefficients $x_1, x_2, x_3$, and $x_4$ ....

1. Where will the pen be at time $t=0$?
2. Where will the pen be at time $t=1$?
3. Consider the velocity $\partial_t x(t)$ of the pen. (We're thinking of the $x$- direction only. The pen will also have a $y$-component of velocity.)
    a. What is the velocity of the pen at $t=0$, that is, what is $\partial_t x(t=0)$? You should be able to give an algebraic form for this.
    b. Imagine that the pen moved with constant initial velocity $\partial_t x(t=0)$. (It doesn't, but imagine that it does.) At what value of $t$, if any, will the pen reach the $x$-value $x_2$?
    c. Find the velocity of the pen at $t=1$. Again, as in (a), you should be able to give an algebraic form for this.
    d. Imagine the pen moving backwards in time from $x(1) = x_4$ at the velocity $\partial_t x(t=1)$. At what time $t < 1$, if any, would the pen have been at value $x_3$?


GIVE VELOCITY, ...


```{r x-curve, echo=FALSE}
xpts <- c(1, 3, 2, 4)
xfun <- function(t) {
  (1-t)^3*xpts[[1]] + 3*(1-t)^2*t*xpts[[2]] + 3*(1-t)*t^2*xpts[[3]] + t^3*xpts[4]
}
slice_plot(xfun(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:1)) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
```
