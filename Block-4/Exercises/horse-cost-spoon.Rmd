Exponential distributions are ***self similar***. Looking at Figure \@ref(fig:exponential-density) and assume that $1/k = 100$ days. According to the density function, the probability of an event happening in the first 100 days is 63.2%. Of course that means there is 36.8% chance that the event will happen after the 100 day mark. If the event does not happen in the first 100 days, there is a 63.2% chance that it will happen in interval 100-200 days. Similarly, if the event does not happen in the first 200 days, there is a 63.2% chance that it will happen in interval 200-300 days. Use these facts to calculate the probability mass in each of these intervals:

- 0-100 days
- 100-200 days
- 200-300 days
- 300-400 days

Hint: Make sure that the sum of these probability masses does not exceed 1.
