The two graphs below show the same set of knot points. The interpolating function in one graph is a cubic spline; in the other it is a quadratic spline.

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1013)
Pts <- tibble(x=1:6, y = rnorm(length(x)))
fquad <- qspliner(y ~ x, data = Pts)
fcubic <- spliner(y ~ x, data = Pts)
P1 <- slice_plot(fquad(x) ~ x, domain(x=1:6)) %>%
  gf_point(y ~ x, data = Pts, color="orange", size=3, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Function A")
P2 <- slice_plot(fcubic(x) ~ x, domain(x=1:6)) %>%
  gf_point(y ~ x, data = Pts, color="orange", size=3, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Function B")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(P1, P2, ncol=2)
```

1. Which plot shows the cubic spline?
2. What is it about the shapes of the two interpolating functions that motivated your answer to (1)?
