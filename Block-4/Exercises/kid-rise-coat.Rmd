We introduced Newton's method as a technique for finding zeros of functions. For instance, for finding zeros of $g(x)$, you would apply the function better() iteratively to an initial guess $x_0$.

$\text{better}(x) \equiv x - \frac{g(x)}{\partial_x g(x)}$

A. Suppose your goal is not to find a zero of $g(x)$ but instead to find an **argmax**. One way to do this is to find the zeros of $\partial_x g(x)$.  Write down the Newton-step suitable for the argmax problem.

B. Imagine that $g(x)$ has an output of miles-per-gallons and an input speed in miles-per-hour. What will be the dimension of the Newton step for the optimization problem?


C. Taking into account the dimension of the input $x$ and of the output $f(x)$, what is the dimension of the step $-f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)$. Explain why this makes sense in terms of what a step needs to be.
