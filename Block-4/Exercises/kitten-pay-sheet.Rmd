In Figure \@ref(fig:contest-compare) estimate the area under each of the three curves. Which of these is true? Keep in mind that your estimates will at best be an approximation, so remember to use your theoretical knowledge of probability density functions to refine your estimates.

* area(Louisa) > area(Geoff)
* area(Geoff) > area(Johnny)
* none of the above
