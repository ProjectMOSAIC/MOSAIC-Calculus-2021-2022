The functions `dunif()`, `dnorm()`, and  `dexp()`, respectively, implement the uniform, gaussian, and exponential families of distributions. The word "family" is used because each each family has it's own parameters:

- Uniform: min and max
- Gaussian: mean and sd
- Exponential: rate (with the exponential function parameterized as $\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\text{rate}}\right)$.)


Pick 3 very different sets of parameters for each family. (They should be meaningful, for instance sd $>0$ and rate $>0$.) 

1. Numerically integrate each of the 9 distributions to confirm that the total probability is 1.

2. Compute the expectation value of each of the 9 distributions.

3. Compute the variance of each of the 9 distributions.

Hand in your commands for each of the above tasks and the corresponding output.
