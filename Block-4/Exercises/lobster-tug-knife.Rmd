`r under_construction()`

* Calculate the forward force generated by a rocket engine A that generates a mass $m$ of backward-moving particles at velocity $v_A$. Compare this to an engine B that uses the same energy of combustion to entrain a much larger mass, say $10 m$, to a slower velocity $v_B$. Conservation of energy dictates that $\frac{1}{2} m v_A^2 = \frac{1}{2} 10 m v_B^2$, so you can figure out $v_B$ from $v_A$. Given $v_B$, you can find the momentum of the entrained mass. How does the force generated by engine B compare to the force generated by engine A.
