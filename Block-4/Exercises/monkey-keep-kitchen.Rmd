In this exercise, you're going to show that each of the Bezier spline functions  
$$x(t) = (1-t)^3\, x_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\, x_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\, x_3 + t^3\, x_4\\\text{and}\\
y(t) = (1-t)^3\, y_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\, y_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\, y_3 + t^3\, y_4$$
have a function graph that leaves the first value ($x_1$ or $y_1$) and initially ($t=0$) heads in a straight-line direction toward the first control point ($x_2$ or $y_2$).

You already know that $x(t=0) = x_1$ and $y(t=0) = y_2$.

A. Calculate the initial slopes $\partial_t x(t)\left.{\Large\strut}\right|_{t=0}$ and $\partial_t y(t)\left.{\Large\strut}\right|_{t=0}$.

B. Calculate the slope of a straight-line reaching from $(0, x_1)$ to $({\small\frac{1}{3}}, x_2)$. Show that this matches the slope $\partial_t x(t)\left.{\Large\strut}\right|_{t=0}$ and similarly for the $y(t)$ control points.
