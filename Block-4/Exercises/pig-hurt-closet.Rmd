The mathematician's preferred format for discounting functions is $e^{kt}$, while the banker's is $(1+r)^{-t}$. 

Derive an expression for $k$ in terms of $r$ so that the mathematician's and banker's forms are completely equivalent.

Use the computer to confirm your expression by plotting out both $(1+r)^{-t}$ and $e^{kt}$, with $k$ set according to your expression. (Hint: Pick a particular interest rate, say $r=7\%$.)
