Consider a set of $n$ knot points $(t_i, x_i)$ and imagine that you have two different spline functions, $s_a(t)$ and $s_b(t)$, each of which passes through every one of the knot points.

Under what conditions, if any, can a linear combination of $s_a(t)$ and $s_b(t)$ also be a spline function that passes through each of the knot points?
