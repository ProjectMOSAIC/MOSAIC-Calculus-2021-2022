$e^{-k x}$ can be thought of as a relative density function. Why?

<!-- It's never negative. --> 

The exponential probability function `dexp()` is a scaled version of the relative density function. Find, symbolically, the scalar by which $e^{-k x}$ must be multiplied to turn it into a probability density function.

<!-- 1/k  -->
