Plot out `dnorm()` on semi-log axis. You can choose your own mean and sd, and your graphics domain should cover at least mean $\pm 3$sd. 

1. Describe the shape of the function graph on semi-log axes. 
2. Explain what about the graphic indicates that `dnorm(x)` will never be zero for any finite `x`.
