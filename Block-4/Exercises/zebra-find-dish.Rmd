The figure shows the path(s) of a ray of light travelling through three layers of an optical medium. Each layer has a different ***index of refraction***, which reflects the speed of light in that medium compared light travelling in empty space.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}

```
At each interface between media with differing indices of refraction, the light is ***reflected***. The proportion of light reflected at the interface 0-1 is 
$$R_{0,1} = \left(\frac{n_0-n_1}{n_0+n_1}\right)^2\ .$$

Similarly, at interface 1-2, a fraction $$R_{1,2} = \left(\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\right)^2\ .$$

The total amount reflected in passing through both layers is approximately $R_{0,1} + R_{1,2}$.

The point of sandwiching optical elements in this way is to reduce reflection (or, equivalently, increase the transmission of light). Correspondingly, we'll call the $n_1$ layer an ***anti-reflection*** layer. Special materials are selected for such layers in order to minimize reflection.

Suppose that the indices of fraction $n_0 = 1$ and $n_2 = 2$.

a. What is the optimal value of $n_1$ (argmax) in the anti-reflective layer to minimize the total reflection of light passing from the left optical element into the right optical element? What proportion of light is reflected at that argmax?

b. Suppose that there were no anti-reflective layer, that is, the $n_0$ element abutted directly on the $n_2$ region. What fraction of light would be reflected then?

c. There can be more than one anti-reflective layer. Imagine that the $n_1$ layer were replaced with two layers, which we'll call $A$ and $B$, with indices of refraction $n_A$ and $n_B$. 
    i. What are the optimal values for $n_A$ and $n_B$ to maximize transmission from the $n_0$ medium to the $n_1$ medium?
    ii. Can the two-layer scheme improve transmission compaared to the 1-layer scheme?
