Until now, our presentation of calculus has featured functions, sometimes expressed as formulas involving combinations of the basic modeling functions, sometimes generated directly from data by splines. Now we turn to a new framework for expressing functions, the inputs on which they operate, and the kind of outputs they generate.

This framework is central to technical work in a huge range of fields. The usual name given to it by mathematicians is ***linear algebra***, although only the word "linear" conveys useful information about the subject. The physicists developing the first workable quantum theory called it ***matrix mechanics***. The framework is fundamental to scientific computation and is often the approach of choice even to non-linear problems. Application of the framework to problems of information access was the spark that ignited the modern era of search engines. 

Although the words "algebra" and "quantum" may suggest that conceptual difficulties are in store, in fact human intuition is well suited to establishing a useful understanding. We will use two formats to introduce linear algebra: (1) geometric and visual; (2) via simple arithmetic, numbers, and algorithms.

## Length & direction

A vector is a mathematical idea that is deeply rooted in everyday physical experience. Geometrially, a vector is simply an object consisting only of  ***length*** and ***direction***. 

A pencil is a good physical metaphor for a vector, but a pencil has other, non-vector qualities such as diameter, color, and an eraser. And, being a physical object, a pencil always has position: the place it's at.

```{r two-vectors-pencils, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Three pencils, but just two vectors. The yellow and blue pencils have the same length and direction, so they are exactly the same vector. Pencils have position, but vectors don't. The green pencil shares the same direction, but it has a different length, so it is a different vector from the blue/yellow vector.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/pencils/two-vectors.png")
```

You can move in a given direction either forward or in reverse. To eliminate this ambiguity, it's helpful to imagine vectors having a ***tip*** and a ***tail***. For the pencil illustrations, the writing end it the tip and the eraser is the tail.

```{r opposing-pencils, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Two different vectors. They have the same length and are parallel, but they point in opposite directions.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/pencils/opposing-vectors.png")
```

Vectors are always ***embedded*** in a ***vector space***. Our physical stand-ins for vectors, the pencils, were photographed on a table top: a two-dimensional space. Naturally, the pencil-vectors are also embedded in our everyday three-dimensional space. The table-top can be thought of as a representation of a two-dimensional ***subspace*** of three-dimensional space.

Often, we will use vectors to represent a change in position, that is, a ***step*** or ***displacement*** in the sense of "step to the left" or "step forward." An individual vector describes a step of a specific length in a particular direction. Much of the useful mathematics of vectors can be understood as constructing instructions for reaching a target: "take three and a half steps along the green vector, then turn and take two steps backwards along the yellow vector."

Vectors embedded in three-dimensional space are central to physics and engineering. Quantities such as force, acceleration, and velocity are properly represented not as simple numerical quantities but as vectors with ***magnitude*** (that is, length) and direction. The statement, "The plane's velocity is 450 miles per hour to the north-north-west" is perfectly intelligible to most people, describing magnitude and direction. Note that the vector velocity can be understood without having to know where the plane is located; vectors have only the two qualities of magnitude and direction. Position is irrelevant to describing velocity, or, for that matter, force or acceleration.

The gradients that we studied with partial differentiation (Chapter `r Chaps$gradient`) are vectors. A gradient's direction points directly uphill from a given point; it's magnitude tells how steep the hill is at that point. 

Vectors are a practical tool in many situations such as relative motion. Consider the problem of finding an aircraft heading and speed to intercept another plane that's also moving. The US Navy training movie from the 1950s shows how such calculations used to be done with paper and pencil.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j197C0XuNUA?start=20" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Nowadays such relative motion calculations are computerized. You may well wonder how the computer is able to represent vectors, since pencils aren't part of computer hardware. The answer is disappointingly simple: the properties of direction and magnitude can also be represented by a set of numbers. Two numbers will do for a vector embedded in two-dimensional space, three for a vector embedded in three-dimensional space.

Representing a vector as a set of numbers requires the imposition of a framework: a coordinate system. In Figure \@ref(fig:vector-graph-paper), the vector (that is, the green pencil) has been placed in a coordinate system. Usually you would expect there to be labels for each of the coordinate lines, but this labeling is not necessarily to show a vector (even if it is needed to specify a *position*). The two coordinates to be assigned to the vector are the difference between the tip and the tail. In the figure, there are 20 units horizontally and 16 units vertically, so the vector is $(20, 16)$. 

```{r vector-graph-paper, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Representing a vector as a set of numbers requires reference to a coordinate system, shown here as graph paper.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/pencils/graph-paper.png")
```

By convention, when we write a vector as a set of coordinate numbers, we write the numbers in a ***column***. For instance, the vector in Figure \@ref(fig:vector-graph-paper), which we'll call $\vec{green}$,  is written numerically as:

$$\vec{green} \equiv \left[\begin{array}{c}20\\16\end{array}\right]$$
In more advanced linear algebra, the distinction between a ***column vector*** (like $\vec{green}$) and a ***row vector*** (like $\left[20 \ 16\right]$) is important. For our purposes in this block, we will only have need of column vectors. 



::: {.rmosaic data-latex=""}
Column vectors can be constructed with the `rbind()` function, as in

```{r}
rbind(1,3,-4)
```

Note that the elements are separated by commas in the same way as any other R function.

Later in this block, we will be using data frames to define vectors. We'll introduce the R syntax for that when we need it. 
:::

::: {.takenote data-latex=""}
If you have previous experience with R, say in a statistics course, or if you regard yourself as an expert, please note the following. The R language has a data structure called a "vector," which is a set of elements *without* the information needed to consider it a row or column vector. As such, the native R "vector" is not suited for linear-algebra computations in R.  

Many people construct mathematical vectors using the `matrix()` function. Such a `matrix()` command to produce a column vector would look like `matrix(c(1, 3, -4), ncol=1)`. This is a professional practice, but we regard it as too verbose for our purposes in this book. We will use `rbind()` instead. Note that combining `rbind()` with `c()` or other preconstructed R "vectors" will not produce a mathematical row vector

```{r}
rbind(c(1,2,3))
rbind(1:5)
```

Eventually, we will be constructing matrices. We'll do this by concatenating column vectors, e.g.

```{r}
cbind(
    rbind( 1,  2,  3),
    rbind(10, 11, 12)
)
```

:::



In physics and engineering vectors are used to describe positions, velocities, acceleration, forces, momentum, and other such functions of time or space. In mathematical notation, such a velocity can be written $\vec{v}(t)$. It's common to perform calculus operations such a differentiation, writing it as $\partial_t \vec{v}(t)$.

The vector-valued function of time $\vec{v}(t)$ can also be written in terms of scalar-valued components assembled into a vector. For instance, a subscript is often used to identify which component is which, so that $$\vec{v}(t) = \left[\begin{array}{c}v_x(t)\\v_y(t)\\v_z(t)\end{array}\right]$$ where the $x$, $y$, and $z$ refer to the axes of the coordinate system. 

Since the physics and engineering vectors are typically 2- or 3-dimensional, when working numerically there's not much lost by keeping track of the components with a set of scalar quantities rather than as a vector. You saw this already in Chapter `r Chaps$splines` when we represented the instantaneous vector position of a robot arm as a pair of scalar-valued functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. 

In linear algebra, vectors often have many more than 3 components. In this book, we will work with vectors with hundreds of components. Services like Google search rely on vector calculations with millions of components. When programming such systems, representing the vectors as individual scalar components is unwieldy. The programming must rely on handling the whole vector as a single entity.







## The n^th^ dimension

Living as we do in a palpably three-dimensional space, and being part of a species whose senses and brains developed in three dimensions, it's hard and maybe even impossible to get a grasp on what higher-dimensional spaces would be like.

A lovely 1884 book, *[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)*  features the inhabitants of a two-dimensional world. The central character, Square, receives a visitor, Sphere, from the three-dimensional world in which Flatland is embedded. Only with difficulty can Square assemble a conception of Sphere from the appearing, growing, and vanishing of Sphere's intersection with the flat world. Square's attempt to convince Sphere that his three-dimensional world might be embedded in a four-dimensional one leads to rejection and disgrace.  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBbZmwROv84" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Even if the spatial extent of higher dimensions is not accessible, the one-dimensional vector inhabitants of any such space can be readily perceived and constructed as a list of numbers. With this device, allow us to introduce vectors from 4, 5, and 6 dimensions, and even $n$ dimensional space.

$$\left[\begin{array}{r}6.4\\3.0\\-2.5\\17.3\end{array}\right]\ \ \ \left[\begin{array}{r}-14.2\\-6.9\\18.0\\1.5\\-0.3\end{array}\right]\ \ \ \left[\begin{array}{r}5.3\\-9.6\\84.1\\5.7\\-11.3\\4.8\end{array}\right]\ \ \ \cdots\ \ \ \left.\left[\begin{array}{r}7.2\\-4.4\\0.6\\-4.1\\4.7\\\vdots\ \ \\-7.3\\8.3\end{array}\right]\right\} n$$

Sensible people may consider it mathematical ostentation to promote an everyday column of numbers into a vector in high-dimensional space. The utility of doing so is to help us think about the arithmetic we are about to do on vectors in terms of familiar geometrical concepts: lengths, angles, alignment, and so on. Perhaps unexpectedly, it also guides us to think about data---which consists of columns of numbers in a data frame---using our powerful geometrical intuition.

There's nothing science-fiction-like about so-called "high-dimensional" spaces; they are not usually intended to correspond to a physical space. Vectors with many components are often used in advanced physics to represent the state of a particle. For instance, the state vector could contain both the position and velocity and might be written $(x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z)$, but you can easily see this as the concatenation of a position vector and a velocity vector, each of which is 3-dimensional. In statistics, engineering, and statistical mechanics, the term ***degrees of freedom*** is used as an alternative to "dimension." Another example: computer-controlled machine tools are often described as having 5 degrees of freedom (or more). There is a cutting head whose $x, y, z$ position can be set as well as the head's orientation (tilt) as an azimuth and inclination. If ever you start to freak out about the idea of a 10-dimensional space, just close your eyes and remember that this is only shorthand for the set of arrays with 10 elements. 

## Geometry & arithmetic

There are three common mathematical tasks involving vectors that can be understood with simple geometry. Given a set of vectors drawn on paper, you can carry out these tasks by pencil assisted by a simple ruler and a protractor.

1. Measure the ***length*** of a vector.
2. Measure the ***angle*** between two vectors.
3. Create a new vector by ***scaling*** a vector. Scaling makes the new vector longer or shorter or point in the opposite orientation, but the direction remains identical to the original.

The geometrical perspective is helpful for many purposes, but often we need to work with vectors using computers. For this, we use the numerical representation of vectors. 

This section introduces the arithmetic of vectors. With this arithmetic in hand, we can carry out the above tasks (and more!) on vectors that consist of a column of numbers. Especially noteworthy is that the arithmetic enables to to apply simple geometrical concepts to vectors in three or more dimensions.

To ***scale a vector*** $\vec{w}$ means more or less to change the vector's length. A good mental image for scaling is based on thinking about the vector as a ***step*** or ***displacement*** in the direction of $\vec{w}$. Scaling means to go on a simple walk, taking one step after the other in the same direction as the $\vec{w}$. We write a scaled vector by placing a number in front of the name of the vector. $3 \vec{w}$ is a short walk of three steps; $117 \vec{w}$ is a considerably longer walk; $-5 \vec{w}$ means to take five steps backwards. You can also take fraction steps: $0.5 \vec{w}$ is half a step, $19.3 \vec{w}$ means to take 19 steps followed by a 30% step. Scaling a vector by $-1$ means flipping the vector tip-for-tail; this doesn't change the length, just the orientation.

Arithmetically, scaling a vector is accomplished simply by multiplying each of the vector's components by the same number. Suppose that we are working with a vector $\vec{v}$ that has $n$ components. (We'll also define another vector $\vec{w}$ to use in examples.)

$$\vec{v} \equiv \left[\begin{array}{r}6\\2\\-4\\\vdots\\1\\8\end{array}\right]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{w} \equiv \left[\begin{array}{r}-3\\1\\-5\\\vdots\\2\\5\end{array}\right]$$
To scale a vector by 3 is accomplished by multiplying each component by 3

$$3\, \vec{v} = 3\left[\begin{array}{r}6\\2\\-4\\\vdots\\1\\8\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{r}18\\6\\-12\\\vdots\\3\\24\end{array}\right]$$
This is perfectly ordinary multiplication applied component by component, that is, ***componentwise***. 

Scaling involves a number (the "scalar") and a single vector. There are other sorts of multiplication however, that involve two or more vectors.

The ***dot product*** is one approach to multiplication of one vector with another. The dot product between $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ is written $$\vec{v} \bullet \vec{w}$$. 

The arithmetic of the dot product involves two steps:

i. Multiply the two vectors component-wise. For instance:
$$\underset{\Large \vec{v}}{\left[\begin{array}{r}6\\2\\-4\\\vdots\\1\\8\end{array}\right]}\  \underset{\Large \vec{w}}{\left[\begin{array}{r}-3\\1\\-5\\\vdots\\2\\5\end{array}\right]} = \left[\begin{array}{r}-18\\2\\20\\\vdots\\2\\40 \end{array}\right]$$
ii. Sum the elements in the component-wise product. For the component-wise product of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, this will be $-18 + 2 + 20 + \cdots +2 + 40$. The resulting sum, which is an ordinary quantity, that is, a scalar, is the output of the dot product.
That is, the dot product takes two vectors as inputs and produces a scalar as an output.

::: {.rmosaic data-latex=""}
R/mosaic provides a beginner-friendly function for computing a dot product. To mimic the use of the dot, as in $\vec{v} \bullet \vec{w}$, the function will be invoked using ***infix notation***. You have a huge amount of experience with infix notation, even if you never heard the term. Some examples:

```
3 + 2       7 / 4      6 - 2      9 * 3     2 ^ 4
```

Infix notation is distinct from the ***functional notation*** that you are also familiar with, for instance `sin(2)` or `makeFun(x^2 ~ x)`.

In principle, you could invoke the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` operations using ***functional*** notation. Nobody does this because the commands are so ugly:

```{r compact=TRUE}
`+`(3, 2)
`/`(7, 4)
`-`(6, 2)
`*`(9, 3)
`^`(2, 4)
```

&nbsp;

The R language makes it possible to define new infix operators, but there is a catch. The new operators must always have a name that begins and ends with the `%` symbol, for example `%in%` or `%*%` or `%dot%`. You'll be using `%*%` and `%dot%` a lot in this block and the next.

Here's an example of using `%dot%` to calculate the dot product of two vectors:

```{r}
a <- rbind(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
b <- rbind(1, 4, 2, 3, 2, -1)
a %dot% b
```



The vectors being combined with `%dot%` must both have the same number of elements. Otherwise, an error message will result:

```{r error=TRUE}
rbind(2, 1) %dot% rbind(3, 4, 5)
```

:::

To the student encountering the dot product for the first time, a natural response is to wonder what such a two-step operation might be good for. As we progress through this block, you'll see the dot product playing a central role.

::: {.takenote data-latex=""}
You will be seeing a lot of the dot product, so it's important to have it firmly in mind that a ***dot product*** is not ordinary multiplication.
:::

## Vector lengths {#vector-length}

The arithmetic used to calculate the length of a vector is based on the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector $\vec{u} = \left[\begin{array}{c}4\\3\end{array}\right]$ the vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 4 and 3 respectively. Therefore, $$\|\vec{u}\| = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = 5\ .$$
For vectors with more than two components, follow the same pattern: sum the squares of the components then take the square root.

The length of a vector $\vec{u}$ can also be computed using the dot product:
$$\|\vec{u}\| = \sqrt{\strut\vec{u} \bullet \vec{u}}\ .$$
Although length has an obvious physical interpretation, in many areas of science including statistics and quantum physics, the ***square length*** is a more fundamental quantity. The square length of $\vec{u}$ is simply $\|\vec{u}\|^2 = \vec{u}\bullet \vec{u}$.

::: {.example data-latex=""}
Consider the two vectors 
$$\vec{u} \equiv \left(\begin{array}{c}3\\4\end{array}\right) \  \  \ \mbox{and}  \ \ \ \vec{w} \equiv \left(\begin{array}{c}1\\1\\1\\1\end{array}\right)
$$

The length of $\vec{u}$ is $|| \vec{u} || = \sqrt{\strut 3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\strut 25} = 5$.

The length of $\vec{w}$ is $|| \vec{w} || = \sqrt{\strut 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\strut 4} = 2$.
:::

::: {.intheworld data-latex=""}
In statistics, the many applications of linear algebra often involve a simple constant vector, which we'll write $\vec{1}$. It is simply a column vector of 1s, 
$$\vec{1} \equiv \left[\begin{array}{c}1\\1\\1\\\vdots\\1\\1\\ \end{array}\right]\ .$$
Common statistical calculations can be expressed compactly in vector notation. For example, if $\vec{x}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector, then the ***mean*** of the components of $\vec{x}$, which is often written $\bar{x}$, is 
$$\bar{x} \equiv \frac{1}{n}\  \vec{x} \bullet \vec{1}\ .$$ The symbol $\bar{}$ is pronounced "bar", and $\bar{x}$ is pronounced "x-bar.".




Another commonly used statistic is the ***variance*** of the components of a vector $\vec{x}$. This is only slightly more complicated than the mean:
$$\text{var}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{n-1}\  (\vec{x} - \bar{x}) \bullet (\vec{x} - \bar{x})\ .$$
The quantity $\vec{x} - \bar{x}$ is an example of ***scalar*** subtraction, which is done on a component-wise basis. For instance, with $$\vec{x} = \left[\begin{array}{r}1\\2\\3\\4\\\end{array}\right]$$ then $\bar{x} = 2.5$. This being the case, $$\vec{x} - \bar{x} = \left[\begin{array}{c}-1.5\\-0.5\\\ 0.5\\\ 1.5\\\end{array}\right]\ ,$$
with the variance of $\vec{x}$ being $$\frac{1}{4-1} \left[\begin{array}{r}-1.5\\-0.5\\0.5\\1.5\\\end{array}\right] \bullet \left[\begin{array}{r}-1.5\\-0.5\\0.5\\1.5\\\end{array}\right] = \frac{5}{3}\ .$$
:::

## Angles

Any two vectors of the same dimension have a distinct ***angle*** between them. This is easily seen for two-dimensional vectors. Draw two vectors on a sheet of paper. Since vectors have only two properties, length and direction, in your mind's eye you can pick up one of the vectors and relocate its "tail" to meet the tail of the other vector. 

Measure the angle between two vectors the short way round: between 0 and 180 degrees. Any larger angle, say 260 degrees, will be identified with its circular complement: 100 degrees is the complement of a 260 degree angle.

In 2- and 3-dimensional spaces, we can measure the angle between two vectors using a protractor: arrange the vectors so they are tail to tail, align the baseline of the protractor with one of the vectors and read off the angle marked by the second vector.

It's also possible to measure the angle using arithmetic. Suppose we have vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ that are in the same dimensional space. That is, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ have the same number of components:

$$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{c}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\\\end{array}\right]\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \vec{w} = \left[\begin{array}{c}w_1\\w_2\\\vdots\\w_n\\\end{array}\right]\ ,$$


Using the dot-product and length notation, we can write the formula for the **cosine of the angle** between two vectors as 
$$\cos(\theta) \equiv \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{\|\vec{v}\|\ \|\vec{w}\|}\ .$$

::: {.takenote data-latex=""}
Remember that the dot-product-based formula above gives the **cosine of the angle** between the two vectors. It turns out that in many applications, the cosine is exactly what's needed.
If you insist on knowing the angle $\theta$ rather than $\cos(\theta)$, the trigonometric function $\arccos()$ will do the job. For instance, if $\theta$ is such that $\cos(\theta) = 0.6$, compute the angle in degrees with
```{r}
acos(0.6)*180/pi
```

The trigonometric functions in R (and in most other languages) do calculations with angles in units of ***radians***. The `180/pi` is the factor that converts radians to degrees. 
Figure \@ref(fig:cosine-conversion) shows a graph of converting $\cos(\theta)$ to $\theta$ in degrees.

```{r cosine-conversion, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The $\\arccos()$ function (`acos()` in R) converts $\\cos(\\theta)$ to $\\theta$.", out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
slice_plot(180*acos(theta)/pi ~ theta, domain(theta=-1:1), npts=300) %>%
    gf_labs(x="cos(theta)", y = "theta (degrees)") %>%
    gf_refine(scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,15, 30,45,60,75, 90,105, 120,135,150,165, 180)))
```
:::

::: {.intheworld data-latex=""}
What does the angle $\theta$ between two vectors tell us?

In geometrical terms, the angle tells us how strongly aligned the vectors are. An angle of 0 tells us the vectors point in exactly the same direction, and angle of 180 degrees means that the vectors point in exactly opposing directions. Either of these---0 or 180 degrees---indicates that the two vectors are perfectly aligned. Such alignment means that by appropriate scalar multiplication, the two vectors could be made exactly equal to one another and, consequently, that the scaled vectors would be one and the same.

Angles such as 5 or 175 degrees indicate that the two vectors are mostly aligned, but imperfectly. When the angle is 90 degrees of course---a right angle---the two vectors are perpendicular.

The vector alignment has a particularly important meaning in terms of data. Suppose the two vectors are two columns in a data frame: two different variables. In statistics there is an important quantity called the ***correlation coefficient***, denoted $r$. To say that two variables are correlated means that the variables are connected to one another in some way. For instance, among children, height and age are correlated. Since height tends to increase along with age (for children), the two variables are said to be ***positively correlated***. The largest possible correlation is $r=1$. 

A ***negative correlation*** means that as one variable increases the other tends to decrease. Temperature and elevation are negatively correlated, as are the pressure and volume of a gas at a given temperature. The most negative possible correlation is $r=-1$.


A ***zero correlation*** indicates that there is no simple relationship between the two variables. This occurs when the variables are **orthogonal**, a term described in Section \@ref(orthogonality).

In terms of vectors, that is, the columns in the data frame, the correlation coefficient $r$ is exactly the same quantity as the cosine of the angle between the vectors. At the time the correlation coefficient was invented in the 1880s, it was not widely appreciated that $r$ is simply the cosine of an angle. Perhaps the several generations of statistics students who have studied correlation would have had a better grasp on the subject if it had been called ***alignment*** and measured in degrees.
:::

## Orthogonality {#orthogonality}

Two vectors are said to be ***orthogonal*** when the angle between them is 90 degrees. In everyday speech we call a 90 degree angle a "right angle." The word "orthogonal" is really just a literal translation of "right angle." (The syllable "gon" indicates an angle, as in the five-angled pentagon or six angled hexagon. "Ortho" means "right" or "correct," as in "orthodox" (right beliefs) or "orthodontics" (right teeth) or "orthopedic" (right feet).)

Two vectors are at right angles---we prefer "orthogonal" since "right" has many meanings not related to angles---when the dot product between them is zero.

Find a vector that is orthogonal to $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}1\\2\end{array}\right]$.

The arithmetic trick is to reverse the order of the components and put a minus sign in front of one of them, so $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}-2\\1\end{array}\right]$.

We can confirm the orthogonality by calculating the dot product: $\left[\begin{array}{c}-2\\\ 1\end{array}\right] \cdot \left[\strut\begin{array}{r}1\\2\end{array}\right] = -2\times1 + 1 \times 2 = 0$.

In R, this can be written 
```{r}
u <- rbind( 1, 2)
v <- rbind(-2, 1)
u %dot% v

Find a vector orthogonal to $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}1\\2\\3\end{array}\right]$.

We have a little more scope here. A simple approach is to insert a zero component in the new vector and then use the two-dimensional trick to fill in the remaining components.

For instance, starting with $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}0\\ \text{__}\\ \text{__}\end{array}\right]$ the only non-zero components of the dot product will involve the 2 and 3 of the original vector. So $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}0\\ -3\\ 2\end{array}\right]$ is orthogonal. Or, if we start with $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}\text{__}\\0\\\text{__}\end{array}\right]$ we would construct $\left[\strut\begin{array}{r}-3\\ 0\\ 1\end{array}\right]$.
