# Statistical inference



## Categorical inputs

Why a categorical variable corresponds to a set of indicator vectors. Why it wouldn't work to assign numbers 1,2,3,... to the categories (because that would presume that the second category is mathematical between the first and third).

Refer back to the data frame `mtcars` [BUT THIS IS ALL NUMERIC, SO NOT A GOOD SOURCE FOR CATEGORICAL EXAMPLES] displayed on a previous page. Describe how `model.matrix()` used the data to create the right-most vector in the model matrix.

Simulate randomness by re-orienting the residual and finding out what coefficients you would get.

Confidence intervals

Answer questions like: Do we need the interaction term? Do we need the quadratic term? Can the application of Tukey's ladder improve things?

Do p-values on individual coefficients.
