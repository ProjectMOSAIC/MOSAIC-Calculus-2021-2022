Navigators are used to specifying a direction as a compass heading: a single number between 0 and 360. For specifying direction on a plane, this is 
YOU WERE HERE. 




ASK THEM TO FIND LINEAR COMBINATIONS OF COMPASS DIRECTIONS and translate into a heading. (or vice versa.)


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="30%"}
