Figure \@ref(fig:sun-direction) is a kind of treasure map. The starting point (the flagpole) is in the center of the map. 

Find the treasure according to the instructions given in the text: 213 paces away from the sun at 6:32, then 126 paces toward the sun at 12:19. 

Assume that each square of the grid is 15 paces on a side.
