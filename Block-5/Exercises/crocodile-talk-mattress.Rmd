In physics and engineering,  there is a very  important operation called the ***cross product*** and written $\vec{u}\times\vec{v}$. The  operation  is only defined for vectors in 3-dimensional space. The output of the cross product is another 3-dimensional vector which can be calculated arithmetically as:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}a\\b\\c\end{array}\right) \times \left(\begin{array}{c}e\\f\\g\end{array}\right) \equiv
\left(\begin{array}{c}b\, g - c\, f\\c\, e - a\, g\\a\, f - b\, e\end{array}\right)$$

Make up coordinates for two three-dimensional vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ that point in  different directions. 

Calculate the cross product  $\vec{w} \equiv \vec{u} \times \vec{v}$. 

i. Find the angle between $\vec{w}$ and $\vec{u}$.
ii. Find the angle between $\vec{w}$ and $\vec{v}$.

Other than this brief description, we will not use cross products at all in this course. But keep  them  in  mind for your upcoming  physics and engineering courses.
