Collision course?

Consider the diagram showing two straight-line tracks, a dot on each track, and a vector.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/collision.png")
```

Let's imagine that dot 1 is an aircraft and that the black vector attached to it is the aircraft's velocity. We'll call this $\vec{v}_1$, Similarly for dot 2, where the velocity vector will be called $\vec{v}_2$. 

There's a third vector drawn in red: the difference in position of the two aircraft at the exact moment depicted in the drawing.

The question we want to address is whether the aircraft are on a collision course.  Obviously, the two courses cross. So we know that the two aircraft will cross the same point. For a collision, the aircraft have to cross that point at the same time. 

Copy over the drawing to your own piece of paper. You don't need to get the vectors and positions exactly right; any reasonable approximation will do.

Now you are going to do *visual* vector addition and subtraction to answer the collision question.

1) The *relative* velocity of the two planes is the difference between their velocities. Subtract $\vec{v}_2$ from $\vec{v}_1$ and draw the resulting vector. Pay attention to both the *length* and *direction* of the relative velocity.

2) The displacement between the two planes is the red vector: the position of dot 2 subtracted from dot 1. Compare the *directions* of the relative velocity vector and the displacement vector. **If they are aligned, then the planes are on a collision course.**

3) In the picture as drawn, the relative velocity vector and the displacement vector are not aligned. Figure out how much you would need to change the length of $\vec{v}_2$ so that the relative velocity *does* align with the displacement. (Keep the direction the same.) Draw this new vector and label it clearly "vector for intercept."

4) In (3) you changed the *length* of $\vec{v}_2$ keeping the direction the same. Now you are going to keep $\vec{v}_2$ at the original length, but change its direction so that the new relative velocity is aligned with the displacement vector.

Items (3) and (4) are two different ways of designing an intercept of plane 1 by plane 2.

Bonus) You can figure out how long it takes for each plane to reach the intersection point by finding out how many multiples of the velocity vector will cover the line segment between the plane's position and the intersection point. For example, in the original drawing $4 \vec{v}_1$ will bring the plane to the intersection point, so it takes 4 "time units" for the plane to reach the point. (What is the time unit? If velocity is in miles/hour, then the time unit is hours. If the velocity is in feet/second, then the time unit is seconds.) Your task: Figure out where aircraft 2 will be in 4 time units. This will tell you the separation between aircraft 2 and aircraft 1 when 1 reaches the intersection point. Draw and clearly label this vector.
