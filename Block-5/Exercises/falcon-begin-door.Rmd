Referring to  the vectors $\vec{a}$,  $\vec{b}$,  $\vec{c}$, and  $\vec{d}$ in  the figure, construct these  linear combinations. Your diagram should  show  both the scaled  vectors being  added and the output  of the linear  combination.

i. $2 \vec{a}   + 1 \vec{b}$
ii. $1.5 \vec{c} - 2 \vec{d}$
iii.  $- \vec{b} + 2\vec{c}  + 3\vec{d}$
