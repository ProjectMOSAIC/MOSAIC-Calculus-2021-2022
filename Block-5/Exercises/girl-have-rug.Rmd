A. What's the largest possible value for R^2^?

As you know, R^2^ is a ratio of variances. A good way to think of variance is as the square length of a vector. So think about R^2^ as if it were calculated from the square length of $\vec{b}$ and $\hat{b}$.

(Hint: What does the projection problem tell you about the lengths of $\vec{b}$ and $\hat{b}$.)

B. What's the smallest possible value for R^2^? (Hint: What's the smallest possible length for $\hat{b}$?)
