Consider this set of vectors

```{r echo=FALSE,  out.width  = "90%",  fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/basic-vectors.png"))
```

a. Find the lengths of each of these vectors. Assume that the vectors begin and end exactly on the graph-paper intersections.

b. Two pairs of vectors in this set are orthogonal. Which ones?

c. Just using your eye, say whether the dot product between every pair of vectors is positive, zero, or  negative.

    #. A & B
    #. A & C
    #. A & D
    #. A & E
    #. B & C
    #. B & D
    #. B & E
    #. C & D
    #. C & E
    #. D & E
