Consider these functions/vectors on the domain $0 \leq t \leq 1$:


- $s_1(t) \equiv \sin(2\pi t)$
- $s_2(t) \equiv \sin(2 \pi 2 t)$ (that is, $\omega = 2$)
- $s_3(t) \equiv \sin(2 \pi 3 t)$ (that is, $\omega = 3$)
- $c_0(t) \equiv \cos(\pi t)$
- $c_1(t) \equiv \cos(2 \pi t)$
- $c_2(t) \equiv \cos(2 \pi 2 t)$

a. Plot out each of the functions on the domain. How many complete cycles does each function complete as $t$ goes from 0 to 1? 

b. What is the *length* of each function?

c. All of the functions are mutually orthogonal except one. Which is the odd one out? (Hint: If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthgonal.)
