Each of the diagrams below consists of two vectors and  a target point (denoted  with a bull's eye). Being a  point,  the  target has  a definite location  relative  to  the  coordinate axes. 

"Solving"  this sort  of system  amounts to  finding a  linear  combination of the  two  vectors  whose  result is a vector  that can connect  the  origin  to  the  target. (We call this a ***target problem***.)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/4targets.png")
```

Copy over each diagram to your  paper. (Any reasonable approximation will do.) Then,  for each diagram, find the  linear  combination of the two vectors that will reach from the origin to the  target.  Show  your  work, meaning that  you should draw  the  scaled  vectors in a  proper  position  that demonstrates  that they do indeed connect  the  origin to the  target. Underneath  the diagram, write down the numerical  value of the scalars in the  linear combination. (Again, any reasonable approximation will do.)
