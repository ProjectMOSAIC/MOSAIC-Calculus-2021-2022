# Fourier transforms

a. Polynomials as transforms: read off the coefficients to represent the function
b. Functions can be represented as vectors
    i. "Time base"
    ii. Evaluate function at time base
c. Polynomial transform as target problem
    i. extreme sensitivity to small changes in $\vec{b}$
        a. highly collinear: the vectors say only two things:
            i. both arms up.
            i. one arm up, one arm down.
    ii. extrapolate poorly
    iii. But low-order (up to quadratic) is OK.
        i. three shapes of function: flat, arms both up, one arm up and one down
d. Transform into the frequency domain
    i. orthogonal sines and cosines
    ii. sines and cosines are important models of system behavior,
        i. pendula of different lengths
        ii. whistling
        iii. transmission by waves/modulation
