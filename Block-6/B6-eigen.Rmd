# Eigenvalues, eigenvectors

::: {.underconstruction}
8. Eigenvalue/Eigenvector analysis
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. Understand the geometry of the flow (what an eigenvector looks like in terms of the flow, as it emerges from the image of the flow field)
        i. Trajectories as linear combinations of eigenflows
:::

Show that starting on an eigenvector stays on an eigenvector. The time series will be either a growing exponential or a decaying exponential, depending on the sign of $\lambda$.

## Exercises


EXERCISES: Give numbers for $abcd$ and $x(0)$ and $\partial_t x(0)$. Find the eigenvalues and $A$ and $B$.
