Show that starting on an eigenvector stays on an eigenvector. The time series will be either a growing exponential or a decaying exponential, depending on the sign of $\lambda$.

Every $n\times n$ matrix---we are working with $2\times 2$ matrices for simplicity--has associated with it a set of $n$ numbers called *eigenvalues*.  This is a mix of the German word "eigen" meaning "characteristic," and the English work "values." Sometime they are called *characteristic values* just to render them purely in English. But "eigen" has a single, specific meaning in mathematics, so the word "eigenvalue" is more evocative to mathematicians than is "characteristic values."

The letter used to represent eigenvalues is the Greek lambda: $\lambda$. Since our $2\times 2$ matrices have 2 eigenvalues, we often write the pair as $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ or even as $\lambda_{1,2}$. 

For an [ab10] matrix, the formula for the eigenvalues is

$$\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2} \left[a \pm \sqrt{a^2 + 4b\strut}\right]$$

Note the use of the $\pm$ in the formula. The same formula gives *both* eigenvalues, one from the $+$ branch of the $\pm$, the other from the $-$ branch. Using the $\pm$ rather than two different formulas---one with $-$ and one with $+$---is merely a convenience to make it explicit what the two formulas would have in common.

Writing $\lambda_{1,2}$ is nothing more than saying $\lambda_1$ *and* $\lambda_2$.
