7. Fixed points of nonlinear systems in the phase plane 
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. Determine fixed points and linearize the system around the fixed points
        i. Flow field of the linear approximation
        i. Matrix representation of the flow field
        i. Iteration of matrices

8. Eigenvalue/Eigenvector analysis
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. Understand the geometry of the flow (what an eigenvector looks like in terms of the flow, as it emerges from the image of the flow field)
        i. Trajectories as linear combinations of eigenflows
        i. Classification of fixed points
