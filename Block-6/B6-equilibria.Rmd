Many of the natural and constructed objects and systems that we encounter---buildings, bridges, airplanes, the orbits of satellites, heating systems, birds in flight, and so on---are more fully understood if seen as dynamical systems. That may seem strange; a building doesn't move (we hope!), an airplane stays in steady flight, the seasons have been steady in their progression for as long as records have been kept. And yet ... a building might be shaken and even destroyed by an earthquake, airplanes require pilots and control systems for steady flight. Even satellites in far Earth orbit can drift from their desired positions and attitudes and require control corrections.

A system is said to be in ***steady state*** when it stays put, unchanging. Another term often used to express such constancy is ***equilibrium*** which occurs when the various forces or processes acting on the system ***balance out.*** In the language of dynamical systems, the equilibrium state of a system is called a ***fixed point***.  Mathematically, this is a coordinate in the state space where all the right-hand sides of the differential equations equal zero. For a two-dimensional system with dynamics $$\partial_t x = f(x, y)\\\partial_t y = g(x,y)$$, a fixed point will be a particular value for the state which we'll write as $(x^\star, y^\star)$ where both $f(x^\star, y^\star) = 0$ and $g(x^\star, y^\star) = 0$.

An important vocabulary word in dynamics is *transient*. In everyday speech, this means something like "just passing through." It's the same in dynamics: that part of the trajectory which precedes stable, fixed behavior such as at a fixed point. Transients occur whenever a dynamical system has an initial state not on a stable, fixed state. They are also common in systems that are disrupted by some external force, for example in the recovery of an electrical power distribution grid after a disturbance such as an ice storm. After a sharp bang, the ringing in your ears is a transient. When you stand up too suddenly, the "stars" you see are a transient due to diminished blood flow. Turn on an oven? The transient is the warming up until the oven reaches the temperature setting. 

Although transients are ... well, transient, they can be very important. Key to the Wright Bros. success was their recognition that air turbulence elicits transients in attitude and that aircraft need control systems that can work fast enough for the craft to survive the transient. If you have driven a car with a broken suspension, you'll know that it can be hard to control after the transient caused by hitting a bump in the road.

Small disturbances often elicit transients that decay away exponentially. Such transients, like all exponentially decaying processes, can be characterized by a half life: the time it takes the transient to shrink to half its original value. (Not all transients decay exponentially, but that's a story for another course.)
