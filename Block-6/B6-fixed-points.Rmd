## Fixed points

<div style="float:right;">[![](www/icons/edit.png)](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/MOSAIC-Calculus/blob/main/Block-6/B6-fixed-points.Rmd)</div>

i. Classify fixed points as stable/unstable given the dynamics
i. Identify the dynamics of constant growth
i. Compute Euler solutions (format for expressing the system and the format of the result)
i. Analyze models in application contexts (for example Mayâ€™s Cows - a model of bistability in ecology)
