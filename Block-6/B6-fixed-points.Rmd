Many of the natural and constructed objects and systems that we encounter---buildings, bridges, airplanes, the orbits of satellites, heating systems, birds in flight, and so on---are more fully understood if seen as dynamical systems. That may seem strange; a building doesn't move (we hope!), an airplane stays in steady flight, the seasons have been steady in their progression for as long as records have been kept. And yet ... a building might be shaken and even destroyed by an earthquake, airplanes require pilots and control systems for steady flight. Even satellites in far Earth orbit can drift from their desired positions and attitudes and require control corrections.

A system is said to be in ***steady state*** when it stays put, unchanging. Another term often used to express such constancy is ***equilibrium*** which occurs when the various forces or processes acting on the system ***balance out.*** In the language of dynamical systems, the equilibrium state of a system is called a ***fixed point***.  Mathematically, this is a coordinate in the state space where all the right-hand sides of the differential equations equal zero. For a two-dimensional system with dynamics $$\partial_t x = f(x, y)\\\partial_t y = g(x,y)$$, a fixed point will be a particular value for the state which we'll write as $(x^\star, y^\star)$ where both $f(x^\star, y^\star) = 0$ and $g(x^\star, y^\star) = 0$.

## First-order dynamics

We start our exploration of the mathematics and phenomena of fixed points with first-order dynamical system, that is, systems that have a single state variable. (We'll use the letter $x$ for the state variable, even though the context might provide a more descriptive name.)

A fundamental first-order system is $\partial_t x = a x$. To find the fixed point, find a state value $x^\star$ such that the right-hand side of the differential equation evaluated at $x^\star$ gives zero. This is a solving task and simple inspection gives the solution:  $x^\star = 0$.

To develop intuition, consider the flow field of $\partial_t x = a x$. Since there is only a single state variable, $x$, the state space is simply the number line, not a two-dimensional region as in the rabbit-fox dynamics. The flow arrows will point one way or the opposite along the number line, as in Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow):
```{r ax-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1, fig.cap="The flow field of $\\partial_t x = ax$ for $a > 0$."}
phase_line(x ~ x, domain(x=-2:2.3), nix_dyn=TRUE) %>%
  gf_point(0 ~ 0, size=.1, color="blue")
```
Simple as Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow) is, it pays to examine it closely. Each arrow shows $\partial_t x$ at one point in the state space. The rightmost arrow is long and points to the right, that is, to larger values on the number line. As you move leftward, the arrows get shorter but continue to point to the right. This corresponds to $ax$ getting smaller as $x$ heads toward zero.

Similarly, the leftmost arrow is long and points to the left, that is toward more negative values of the number line. As you move rightward from that leftmost arrow, the arrows get shorter but continue to point in the negative direction. 

In the middle, the arrows are very short. The **fixed point** is in between the adjacent left-pointing arrow and right-pointing arrow. We've marked this with a small dot.

Although Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow) is faithful to the one-dimensional state of $\partial_t x = a x$, it doesn't clearly show what is happening *between* consecutive arrows. For this reason, we are going to construct a special-purpose display intended only to show dynamics on the phase line. In this display (Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow2)) we'll draw a graph of the dynamical function using the phase line as the horizontal axis and a vertical axis to show the numberical value of $\partial_t x$ at each point along the horizontal axis.

```{r ax-flow2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A display showing the value of $\\partial_t x$ as a graph, and the flow field as arrows."}
phase_line(x ~ x, domain(x=-2.05:2.3), nix_dyn=FALSE) %>%
  gf_point(0 ~ 0, size=.1, color="blue")
```
In this diagram, you can see that the flow arrows point rightward where $0 < \partial_t x$ and point leftward where $\partial_t x < 0$. The fixed point is at $\partial_t x = 0$, that is, in-between the left- and right-pointing arrows. 

From the graph of $ax$ in Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow2), you can see that $0 < a$ in this example. The case for $a < 0$ is very similar, but there is a fundamental difference in behavior. Let's look first at the flow plot in Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow3).

```{r ax-flow3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The flow field and graph of $\\partial_t x$ for $\\partial_t x = a x$ with $a < 0$."}
phase_line(- x ~ x, domain(x=-2.05:2.3), nix_dyn=FALSE) %>%
  gf_point(0 ~ 0, size=.1, color="blue")
```

As always, where the value of $\partial_t x$ is positive, the flow arrows point to the right and, when $\partial_t x$ is negative, the flow arrows point to the left. The fixed point is where $\partial_t x = 0$. 

The fundamental difference between the $0 < a$ case and the $a < 0$ case has to do with whether and where the state variable reaches an equilibrium. In Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow3), all flow arrows *point toward* the fixed point. This means that whatever is the initial condition $x_0$, eventually the system will end up at the fixed point $x^\star$ (which is $x^\star$ in this example).

Such behavior of converging to a fixed point is said to be ***stable***.

In contrast, when $0 < a$ (Figure \@ref(fig:ax-flow2)), all flow arrows point *away from* the fixed point. Whatever the initial condition $x_0$---with *one* exception---the state will head away from the fixed point. If $0 < x_0$, the state will grow more and more positive. If $x_0 < 0$, the state will grow more and more negative. The exception is when $x_0 = 0$. If the state is *exactly* on the fixed point, it will stay there. Such a situation is said to be ***unstable***, since any minute movement of the state off the fixed point will lead to the state moving farther and farther from the fixed point.

There's nothing in the differential equation $\partial_t x = a x$ that provides a mechanism to move off the fixed point, if it starts exactly on it. However, for a physical system $\partial_t = a x$ is a ***model*** and may not represent aspects of the complete system. A case in point: stand a pencil on its tip and let go. If $\theta$ is the angle the pencil makes with the vertical, a simplistic model of the dynamics is $\partial_t \theta = a \sin(\theta)$, with $0 < a$. This model has a fixed point $\theta^\star = 0$ and so, according to the model, if you can start the pencil standing exactly vertical, it should stay there. But any disturbance---a whisper of breeze, a gnat flapping its wings nearby---will push the pencil out of its vertical equilibrium. You can easily see what happens by doing the experiment: stand a pencil on its tip and let go.

Nonlinear systems can have multiple fixed points. The differential equation $\partial_t x = x(1-x)$ has two: one at $x^\star = 0$ and the other at $x^\star = 1$. The flow-field/dynamics-graph (Figure \@ref(fig:logistic-phase-line)) makes it clear that one of these is stable and the other unstable.

```{r logistic-phase-line, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Flow field and dynamics function for $\\partial_t x = x (1-x)$. The fixed point at $x^\\star=0$ is unstable; that at $x^\\star =1$ is stable."}
phase_line(x*(1-x) ~ x, domain(x=-0.05:1.05), nix_dyn=FALSE) %>%
  gf_point(0 ~ 0, size=.1, color="blue") %>%
  gf_point(0 ~ 1, size=.1, color="blue") 
```
For the system in Figure \@ref(fig:logistic-phase-line), a  initial condition $x_0 = 0.05$ or any other small positive number will produce a trajector that moves slowly to the right at first, then faster, then slows down again for asymptotically approaching the fixed point at $x=1$. In a time series plot, $x(t)$ is a sigmoidal function.

::: {.intheworld data-latex=""}
We have been using the differential equation $\partial_t x(1-x)$ as a mathematical equation, but the form has important applications in population modeling and ecology. When parameterized, the model becomes
$$\partial_t x = h(x) \equiv r x \left(1 - \frac{x}{K}\right)$$
For $x \ll K$, the dynamics are approximately $\partial_t x = rx$, which is the recipe for ***exponential growth***. Such growth is often seen in small populations. But "small" compared to what? To answer that, look at the situation for $x \approx K$. In this domain, the growth will be much smaller, because $(1 - x/K) \approx 0$. There's a fixed point at $x^\star = K$, and for $K < x$ the time derivative of $x$ is negative. 

In ecology, the population size that can just barely sustain itself without growth or decay is called the ***carrying capacity***. Putting these different behaviors together, $\partial_t x = h(x)$ is a model of growth of a population when the environment has a finite carrying capacity. The pattern of change in such an environment is called ***logistic growth***, but might as well be called "sigmoidal growth." (The function $f(x) = \frac{e^t}{1 + e^t}$ is called the "logistic function.")

In this problem, we're going to build a somewhat more complicated model of an ecosystem, based on the logistic growth model for grass. 

To turn a field of growing grass into an eco**system**, we're going to add grazing cows to the field. A grazing cow has an impact on a field. To simplify, consider a single cow. She eats until she's full, then takes time off to chew the cud with other cows and ruminate on the day's events. But, if grass is very scarce, she may not be able to consume all that she would otherwise eat. She'll be a hungry, ill-fed cow. 

When building a model, start by thinking what you want to use the model for. Imagine that we're interested in *sustainability*, that is, whether the cow/grass ecosystem is stable. And, since cows are raised for a purpose, we'd like to use the model to find out whether the cow would be well fed and how things would change if another cow were added to the field. Sustainability is a question about dynamics. Here, the system would be sustainable if the field produces more grass in a day than the cow (and her herd-mates if any) consumes consumes in a day.

We'll model a cow's consumption as a sigmoidal function consumption(v) of the amount of grass (v -- for "vegetation") available. Like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, height=3, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
consumption <- makeFun((beta*v^2/(v0^2 + v^2))~ v, beta=0.1, v0=3)
slice_plot(consumption(v) ~ v, domain(v=c(0,15))) %>%
  gf_labs(y="Consumption (tons/day)", x="v: available biomass (tons)",
          title="Daily consumption by one cow")
```


```{r cow1, echo=FALSE}
explain <- "\"Most hungry\" suggests and extreme value of something. There's nothing extreme values in the middle."
askMC(
  "At what level of available biomass is the cow most hungry at the end of the day? (Hint: Think about how you would measure how hungry a cow is at the end of the day.)",
  "+2 tons+" = "The consumption function is steepest here, meaning that if more grass were available the cow would eat the biggest proportion of it.",
  "5 tons" = explain,
  "10 tons" = explain,
  "15 tons" = "Even if more grass were available, the cow wouldn't each much of it."
)
```

The cow's consumption is one part of the dynamics. If there were no grass growing, the dynamics would be $$\partial_t G(v) = - H \times \text{consumption}(v)$$ where $H$ is the number of cows in the herd. `r mark(6330)`


A more complete model will take into account the intrinsic growth of the grass when there are no cows.  We'll use a logistic model with a carrying capacity of 25 tons of grass in the field.
$$ \partial_t v =  \frac{v}{3} \left(1-\frac{v}{25}\right)$$
This means that, with no cows grazing, the field would reach an equilibrium with 25 tons of vegetation. Subtracting daily consumption from daily growth of grass gives the rate of change of the biomass of grass.

### Fixed points
An important strategy in creating and understanding models of dynamics involves **fixed points**.  A fixed point is a value of the state which the dynamics leave untouched. For finite-difference equation dynamics, $${\mathbf X}_{n+1} = g({\mathbf X}_n)$$

At a fixed point, "tomorrow's" value is the same as "today": ${\mathbf X}_{n+1} = {\mathbf X}_n$; the state doesn't change with $n$. 

A fixed point ${\mathbf X}^\star$ satisfies 
$${\mathbf X}^\star = g({\mathbf X}^\star)\ \ \ \mbox{or, said another way,}\ \ \ g({\mathbf X}^\star) - {\mathbf x^\star} = 0$$
"Fixed point" is a mathematical term. In the sciences, you will hear the term "equilibrium state," "steady state," "resting point," or "balance point." For example, chemistry has a concept of [chemical equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium), a state where the concentration of reactants and products doesn't change. Finding such equilibria is an important task in many areas of science and engineering.

Some dynamical systems don't display any fixed points, e.g. the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Others have one or more. We're going to treat them mathematically by analysis of the function $g()$ that governs the dynamics.

There are several ways to find fixed points. 

1. If you have a simple algebraic form for $g()$ you can solve $g(x) = x$ for $x$. For instance, suppose $g(x) \equiv 4 x (1-x)$. Then the fixed points satisfy $$x^\star = 4x^\star (1-x^\star)$$  This has two solutions: one at $x^\star = 0$ and the other at $x^\star = 3/4$.

```{r ffp-a, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Consider the dynamical system $$x_{n+1} = 2 x_n + 3$$ To find the fixed point, re-write the equation as $x^\\star = 2 x^\\star + 3$ and solve for $x^\\star$. What is the fixed point $x^\\star$?",
  "+-3+" = "Right. Plug in $-3$ for $x^\\star$ in $2 x^\\star + 3$ and you get ... -3. ",
  "-1.5",
  "0", 
  "1.5",
  "3",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r ffp-b, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Consider the dynamical system $$y_{n+1} =  1/y_n + 9$$ To find the fixed point, re-write the equation as $y^\\star = 1/y^\\star + 9$ and solve for $y^\\star$. How many fixed points are there",
  0, 1, "+2+" = "Right, because the equation becomes $(y^\\star)^2 = 9$ which has two solutions, $y^\\star = \\pm 3$.", 3, 4, "an infinite number",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r ffp-c, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "How come the first question used $x_n$ for the state while the second on used $y_n$?",
  "Because you can't write $1/x_n$",
  "Using $y_n$ is a mistake. Dear problem writer, Please be more careful in the future!",
  "+Because you can use any name you like for a variable, so long as you use it consistently. And using $x$ all the time gets tiring, to say nothing about how hard it makes to work with more than one variable at a time.+" = "It would have been fun to use names like $\\mbox{dog_hunger}_n$ or $\\mbox{snowfall}_n$. We used $y_n$ so that we don't freak you out. But $y$ is just a name like any other."
)
```



2. Numerical solving. If solving $g(x)=x$ is not so easy, then we can instead create a new function $h(x)\equiv g(x)-x$ and then solve for the zeros of $h()$.  The point of setting up the helper function $h()$ is that computer algorithms for finding zeros generally take a *function* as their input rather than an *equation*. 

```{r ffp-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Consider the system $$x_{n+1} = 5 [\\cos(x_n)]^2$$ Where are the fixed points? (You can use the sandbox to solve the system numerically.)",
  "+$x^\\star \\in \\{1.086, 2.320, 3.681\\}$+",
  paste("$x^\\star \\in \\{", paste(round(sort(runif(4, 0.5, 4)), 4), collapse=", "), "\\}$"),
  paste0("$x^\\star \\in \\{", paste(round(sort(runif(4, 0.5, 4)), 3), collapse=", "), "\\}$"),
  paste("$x^\\star \\in \\{", paste(round(sort(runif(4, 0.5, 4)), 2), collapse=", "), "\\}$"),
  paste0("$x^\\star \\in \\{", paste(round(sort(runif(4, 0.5, 4)), 3), collapse=", "), "\\}$")
)
```

```{r ffp-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Solving for zeros", exercise.nlines = 6, eval=FALSE}
g <- makeFun(4*x*(1-x) ~ x) #change this formula to answer the multiple choice question
findZeros(g(x) - x ~ x)
```


3. Graphically. Plot out the function $g(x) - x$ versus $x$. Find values of $x$ where the graph crosses zero. Each of these valuesis a fixed point $x^\star$.

For instance:
```{r ffp-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Finding fixed points graphically", exercise.nlines=8, eval=FALSE}
dom <- domain(x = c(0,10))
g <- makeFun(x + sin(x) ~ x) 
slice_plot(g(x) - x ~ x, dom) 
```


4. By iteration. Sometimes you can identify a fixed point by iterating the dynamics starting from different initial conditions. The following sandbox iterates a system for 100 steps. The `tail(5)` function returns just the last 5 rows of the data table, making it easier to see where the state ended up after many iterations.

```{r ffp-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Finding fixed points by iteration", exercise.nlines=8, eval=FALSE}
g <- makeFun(x + sin(x) ~ x)
Iterate(g, x0=.872, 100) %>% tail(5)
```
You can look for different fixed points by trying different values for $x0$. 

```{r fpp-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Find the fixed points of $$g(x) \\equiv x + \\sin(x)$$ by picking several random initial conditions in the range $0 \\leq x \\leq 10$. Compare your results to the fixed points seen using the graphical method. Which of these fixed points does iteration **NOT** reveal? Hint: the initial condition is $x_0$, so this is the value you need to change.",
  "$x^\\star = \\pi$",
  "+$x^\\star = 2\\pi$+",
  "$x^\\star = 3\\pi$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

### Fly dynamics

```{r fly_dyn_def, context="setup", echo=FALSE}
fly_dyn <- function(x, K=1e3, r=1.75e-4) {
  ifelse(x < K,
         0.01*x^2,
         0.01*K^2*exp(-r*(x - K)))
}
```

The year-to-year growth/decline in the number of flies in a mangrove swamp is modeled by the function `fly_dyn()`:
$$x_{t+1} = \mbox{fly_dyn}(x_t)$$

The sandbox shows the function and enables you to perform other calculations using it.

```{r mangrove1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Yearly fly population.", exercise.nlines=8, exercise.setup="fly-dyn-def"}
slice_plot(fly_dyn(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(0,6000)))
```

```{r mangrove2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "At which of these values of $x_t$ do the dynamics have a fixed point? (Hint: How would you confirm that a given value is a fixed point?)",
  "+0, 100, 4981+",
  "0, 100, 121" = "When you give 121 as the input, do you get 121 as the output?",
  "0, 121, 5683",
  "0, 100, 5683" = "When you give 5683 as the input, do you get 5683 as the output?"
)
```

```{r mangrove3, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "Which one of these values for $x$ is an **unstable** fixed point?",
  0, "+100+", 121, 4981, 5683,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

An important vocabulary word in dynamics is *transient*. In everyday speech, this means something like "just passing through." It's the same in dynamics: that part of the trajectory which precedes stable, fixed behavior such as at a fixed point. Transients occur whenever a dynamical system has an initial state not on a stable, fixed state. They are also common in systems that are disrupted by some external force, for example in the recovery of an electrical power distribution grid after a disturbance such as an ice storm. After a sharp bang, the ringing in your ears is a transient. When you stand up too suddenly, the "stars" you see are a transient due to diminished blood flow. Turn on an oven? The transient is the warming up until the oven reaches the temperature setting. 

Although transients are ... well, transient, they can be very important. Key to the Wright Bros. success was their recognition that air turbulence elicits transients in attitude and that aircraft need control systems that can work fast enough for the craft to survive the transient. If you have driven a car with a broken suspension, you'll know that it can be hard to control after the transient caused by hitting a bump in the road.

Small disturbances often elicit transients that decay away exponentially. Such transients, like all exponentially decaying processes, can be characterized by a half life: the time it takes the transient to shrink to half its original value. (Not all transients decay exponentially, but that's a story for another course.)

Using the sandbox, iterate `fly_dyn()` for 50 years starting at $x_0 = 4500$. Here's the command to do this, which you'll have to copy to the sandbox.

```{r results="hide", eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Trajectory <- Iterate(fly_dyn, x0=4500, n=50)
gf_point(x ~ n, data = Trajectory) %>%
  gf_line(alpha = 0.2)
```

```{r mangrove4, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  "There is a transient that oscillates while exponentially approaching the fixed point. What is the half-life of the exponential transient?",
  "1 year",
  "3 years",
  "+6 years+",
  "12 years",
  "24 years",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

### Tree example

A tree provides a simple example of equilibrium. A living tree grows slowly, with essentially no change from day to day. The tree is usually in equilibrium with its surroundings. But there are disruptions that can place the tree out of equilibrium. The wind is a familiar disruption, changing the dynamics so that the tree no longer stands straight and still; it sways in the wind. A severe storm or a chain saw creates an opportunity for bigger disruption, removing the fixed point of upright posture and replacing it with an entirely different sort of fixed point. The steady, slow process of rot can weaken the equilibrium to the point where it no longer exists or is too weak to withstand the wind. The tree falls.

Mathematics provides several concepts for thinking about equilibrium and the loss of equilibrium. The idea of a **fixed point** is at the center of things. The idea of disruption also has a mathematical equivalent called "forcing." The slow change (as in the rot of a tree) leading to a dramatic, sometimes sudden, collapse is represented by a "bifurcation." We'll explore forcing and bifurcation later, when we've developed better tools and ways of thinking to understand dynamics.

Here we will examine the important topic of "stability." The word has a variety of related meanings in everyday life: a patient is stable when his or her condition is not worsening (or getting better), a chair is stable when it won't fall over, a stable personal relationship is much preferred to an unstable one, a person who is stable does not get upset or disturbed by a trivial incident.

In mathematics, "stability" is a property of dynamics near a fixed point. A fixed point is stable when an initial trajectory close enough to the fixed point leads to a trajectory that continues to get closer to the fixed point. A fixed point is unstable when initial conditions close to the fixed point lead to trajectories that tend away from the fixed point. 

In everyday life, we think about stability as a matter of how hard you can push something before it falls over. A coin standing on edge is not very stable in this sense, any palpable disturbance will cause it to fall over. But mathematically, stability is just about the response to infinitesimal disturbances. The coin standing on edge is mathematically stable. Large disturbances may lead to the state of a system leaving even a stable fixed point. Stability of mathematical fixed points is about *local* dynamics. The response to large disturbances is non-local or *global* dynamics, a much harder topic.

The sandbox provides space to explore stability via iteration.

```{r stb1-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Stability sandbox", exercise.nlines = 6, eval=FALSE}
g <- makeFun(5*sin(x)^2 ~ x)
findZeros(g(x) - x ~ x)
Iterate(g, x0 = 0.0001, n=10)
```

The dynamical system $x_{n+1} = 5 [\sin(x_n)]^2$ has five fixed points. Use iteration to determine whether each fixed point is stable or unstable.

```{r stb1-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Using iteration, is the fixed point at $x=0$ stable?", 
  "Yes",
  "No",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  right_one = "Yes"
)
```

```{r stb1-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Using iteration, is the fixed point at $x=0.2027$ stable?",

### Stability

Previously, we examined the stability of fixed points by using iteration: start at an initial condition arbitrarily close (but not exactly on!) a fixed point and see if the trajectory tends toward or away from the fixed point.

Now we'll look at stability another way, by considering the shape of of the dynamical function near a fixed point. At this point in CalcZ, you're aware that "near" suggests local, and that we routinely model (continuous) functions in terms of the value at a point, the value of the derivative at the point, and the value of the 2nd derivative at the point.

The stability of a fixed point is determined in all but very special situations by the slope of the function at the fixed point. Here's the rule: 

> In the dynamical system $x_{n+1} = g(x_n)$ with a fixed point at $x^\star$, the stability of that fixed point depends only on the magnitude of $\left| \partial_x g(x^\star) \right|$. The rule is: 

> If $\left| \partial_x g(x^\star) \right| > 1$, the fixed point at $x^\star$ is **unstable**.

> If $\left| \partial_x g(x^\star) \right| < 1$, the fixed point at $x^\star$ is **stable**.

Notice that it doesn't matter what is the **sign** of $\partial_x g(x^\star)$; the fixed point will be stable or not depending just on the magnitude of the derivative.

```{r stb2-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Stability sandbox", exercise.nlines = 6, eval=FALSE}
g <- makeFun(sin(x)^2 + 1 ~ x)
fixed_points <- findZeros(g(x) - x ~ x)
dg <- D(g(x) ~ x)

## Now, apply dg() to the fixed point(s)
dg(fixed_points)
```

```{r stb2-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Calculate the derivative with respect to $x$ of $g(x) \\equiv  \\sin(x)^2 + 1$ at the fixed point at $x^\\star = 1.8972$. Is that fixed point stable?",
  "+Yes+",
  "No",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

Consider the simple dynamical system $$x_{n+1} = g(x_n) \equiv \frac{1}{2} x_n$$

This has a fixed point $x^\star = 0$. You can see this by plugging in $x^\star = 0$ every place that $x_n$ or $x_{n+1}$ appears in the equation describing the dynamics and confirming that the left side is indeed equal to the right side.

Is the fixed point stable? Calculate $\partial_x g(x^\star)$ and check whether it's absolute value is less than 1. If so, the fixed point is stable. Since $| \partial_x g(x^\star) | = \frac{1}{2} < 1$, the fixed point is stable.

Now consider $$x_{n+1} = g(x_n) \equiv 2 x_n$$ Again, this system has a fixed point $x^\star = 0$. Is it stable? Well, $\partial_x g(x^\star) = 2$. The magnitude $| \partial_x g(x^\star) |$ is clearly greater than 1, so the fixed point is *unstable*.

We could play this game for any number in place of the $\frac{1}{2}$ or $2$. It would quickly get boring, so better to deal with the question once and for all for all possible numbers. We will *parameterize* the system, replacing the quantity that has been $\frac{1}{2}$ or $2$ in the previous examples with a symbol that stands for "some number here":
$$x_{n+1} = \alpha\, x_n$$
Does this system have a fixed point and where is it? The dynamical function is $g(x) = \alpha x$, so solve $g(x) - x = \alpha x^\star - x^\star = 0$. This becomes $$(\alpha - 1) x^\star = 0$$ which implies that $x^\star = 0$ is a fixed point or, if $\alpha=1$, any value for $x^\star$ will satisfy the fixed-point condition.

It's a common style in mathematical discourse to use parameters rather than specific numbers so that we can look at the same time at all systems of the same "form." For instance, we can summarize the stability of fixed points in the system $x_{n+1} = \alpha x_n$ by saying,

- There is a single fixed point at $x^\star = 0$, regardless of $\alpha$.
- That fixed point is stable if $|\alpha| < 1$, otherwise it's unstable. (Pedantic: In the singular case where $|\alpha| = 1$, the fixed point is "neutrally stable" and all points are fixed points.)

The advantage of using parameters is that we can often find the location of fixed points and their stability once and for all *as a function of the parameters*, and then use observed or desired behavior to set conditions on the range of parameter values that will produce that behavior.
