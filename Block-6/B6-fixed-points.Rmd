::: {.underconstruction}
i. Classify fixed points as stable/unstable given the dynamics
i. Identify the dynamics of constant growth
i. Compute Euler solutions (format for expressing the system and the format of the result)
i. Analyze models in application contexts (for example Mayâ€™s Cows - a model of bistability in ecology)

Given a choice between a numerical and a symbolic solution to exactly the same problem, the symbolic solution is generally better: it's exact and it can incorporate parameters symbolically.


> *"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise."* -- John Tukey (1915-2000)
