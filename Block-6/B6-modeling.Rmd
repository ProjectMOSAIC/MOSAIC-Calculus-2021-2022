There are a few differential-equation forms that show up again and again in modeling problems. We're going to introduce them to you here and, later, show you the solutions.

**The proportional growth/decay model**: $\dot{x} = a x$

* Simple population growth. The population is a function of time: $x(t)$. Growth at any instant is proportional to the instantaneous population. For instance a population growing at 3% per year will have $a \approx 0.03$ with units 1/year.
* Radioactive decay. The amount of the radioactive substance is a function of time: $x(t)$. For example, phosphorus-32 (that is, $^{32}$P) has a half life of 14 days. The differential equation is $\dot{x} = -a x$ with $a \approx 0.049$ with units 1/day. `r mark(6295)`

**Change proportional to  difference**: $\dot{x} = - a (x - x_\text{fixed})$

* Newton's Law of Cooling is about how a hot (or cold) object comes into equilibrium with the ambient temperature. For instance, you might have a cup of coffee at $200^\circ$F in a room at $70^\circ$F. Unless you drink it, the coffee will cool with time until it reaches the room's temperature. In this setting, $x_\text{fixed} = 70^\circ$F. The value of $a$ depends on how insulated the cup is (and details of evaporation, etc.). But if the coffee reaches very near to room temperature in 60 minutes, $a \approx 0.5$ with units 1/minute. `r mark(6300)`


```{r basic2a, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What are the units of the output of $x(t)$?",
  "degrees F per minute",
  "+degrees F+",
  "1/minute",
  "1/degrees F"
)
```

```{r basic2b, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What are the units of $\\dot{x}$?",
  "+degrees F per minute+",
  "degrees F",
  "1/minute",
  "1/degrees F"
)
```

```{r basic2c, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is $x$?",
  "the room temperature",
  "the initial temperature of the coffee",
  "+the instantaneous coffee temperature as a function of time+",
  "the fixed rate at which the coffee cools",
  "the instantaneous rate at which the coffee cools as a function of time"
)
```

```{r basic2d, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is $\\dot{x}$?",
  "the room temperature",
  "the initial temperature of the coffee",
  "the instantaneous coffee temperature as a function of time",
  "+the instantaneous rate at which the coffee cools as a function of time+"
)
```

**Limited growth**, e.g. $\dot{x} = r x (1-x/k)$

The proportional-growth model will lead to $x(t)$ increasing without limit. Sometimes that's a good model over short times, before $x(t)$ has a chance to get unrealistically big. But over long periods of time, something's gotta give. `r mark(6305)`

* Population with a "carrying capacity." For $t$ when $x(t)$ is very small, the population growth is well approximated by the usual proportion-growth model.  For intermediate $t$, the population has grown to a large enough size that it is consuming a substantial fraction of the available resources and population growth slows. When the population reaches the "carrying capacity" the growth stops (e.g. birth rate = death rate). `r mark(6310)`

```{r basic3a, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "If the units of $x(t)$ is, say, rabbits, what is the units of $k$?",
  "+rabbits+",
  "rabbits per day",
  "rabbits per week",
  "rabbits per year"
)
```

```{r basic3b, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Suppose the units of $\\dot{x}$ is, rabbits per month, what is the units of $r$?",
  "+1/month+",
  "rabbits per month",
  "months per rabbit",
  "rabbits per month-squared"
)
```

```{r basic3c, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Even without finding the full solution $x(t)$ to the differential equation, you can figure out how big the population will be when growth falls to zero. How big?",
  "+$k$+",
  "$k/r$",
  "$r/k$",
  "$1/r$"
)
```
