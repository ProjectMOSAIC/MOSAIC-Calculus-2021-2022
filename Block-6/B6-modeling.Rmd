5. Models leading to flow fields
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. Apply modeling techniques (from block 2) local low order polynomials
        i. Predatory/Prey (flow fields and the phenomena of the trajectories)
        i. SIR (flow fields and the phenomena of the trajectories)
        i. The differences between these two models
6. Additional models and flow fields (catch up day)
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. (Richardsonâ€™s arms race model and conflict model, action potentials) Numerics, look at the trajectories 
        i. Exercise: `insert_calcZ_exercise("XX.XX", "iRZfBY", "Exercises/walnut-tell-pot.Rmd")`
        i. Analysis of phase plane with nullclines
