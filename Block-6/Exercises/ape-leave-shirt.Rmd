Construct the sequence generated by the discrete-time dynamical system
$$x_{n+1} \equiv -0.8 x_n + 2$$ starting at $x_0 = 10$. 

```{r fdec3-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these best describes the graph $x_n$ versus $n$? (Hint: It's always best to try to figure out the command on your own. If you get stuck, press the 'Solution' button in the sandbox.)",
  "A steady exponential decay to about $x=3$.",
  "An oscillating exponential growth.",
  "+An oscillating exponential decay to about $x=1.1$.+",
  "A sine wave with period $P=\\pi$."
)
```
