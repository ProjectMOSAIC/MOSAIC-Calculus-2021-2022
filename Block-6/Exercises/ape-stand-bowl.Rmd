```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- rfun(~ x, seed=1095)
phase_line(f(x)*dnorm(x) ~ x, domain(x=-5:5))
```

For the dynamical system graphed above, sketch a plausible **time series** solution starting from initial condition $x_0=-2.5$.

<!-- Run the next chunk to see the actual time series.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
traj = integrateODE(dx ~ f(x)*dnorm(x), x = -2.5, tdur = 10)
traj_plot(x(t) ~ t, traj)
```

The students should draw something that has slow growth from $x_0=-2.5$, then fast growth up to about $x=0$, then slow growth again, followed by fast growth, finally leveling off at about $x=3$.
