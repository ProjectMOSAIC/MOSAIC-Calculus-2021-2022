A first-order dynamical system $\partial_t x = g(x)$ can have any number of fixed points, depending on the shape of $g(x)$.

A. Draw a graph of a $g(x)$ that has seven fixed points.

B. Explain why, when there are multiple fixed points, a stable fixed point will have a neighboring fixed point that is unstable, and *vice versa*.
