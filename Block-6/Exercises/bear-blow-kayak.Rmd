Refer to Figure \@ref(fig:chutes-flow) showing the flow from state to state of the dice-free Chutes and Ladders game. 

1. The text mentions a cycle involving state 84. Write down all the other cycles in the flow.

2. The goal of the game is to get to state 100. From how many initial states (other than 100) will the flow eventually lead to state 100.

3. The only terminal endpoint for the flow on the state island shown in the upper left corner of the diagram is state 100. Explain why, in the dice-free game, there cannot possibly be another terminal endpoint for the flow on that state island.
