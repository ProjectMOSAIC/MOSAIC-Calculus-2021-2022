Figure \@ref(fig:linearized-pendulum) shows a flow field of the pendulum system and three pairs of trajectories, one pair for each of three initial conditions. Each trajectory starts at $t=0$ and ends at $t=6$.

A. Read the three different initial conditions from the graph.

B. The dark gray trajectories are for the original (nonlinear) pendulum system while the $\color{magenta}{\text{magenta}}$ trajectories are for the linearized dynamics. Describe in words the differences in the trajectories for the nonlinear and the linearized dynamics.

C. The Which does the flow field correspond to: the nonlinear or linearized dynamics.
