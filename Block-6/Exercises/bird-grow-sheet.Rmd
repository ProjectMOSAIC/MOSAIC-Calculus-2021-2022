The interactive app displayed below implements a version of the pasture-cow dynamics with different parameters than the one in the main body of the text. 

The app draws the various functions involved:

1. The intrinsic logistic model growth dynamics with no cows.
2. The total consumption by the herd of cows.
3. The **net growth**, which is the difference between (1) and (2).

And, you can play the role of farmer by changing the herd size.

</p>
        
Using the app, answer these two questions:

1. How many cows can you put in the pasture before the addition of even a single additional cow will cause collapse of the ecosystem?

2. Once a collapse has occurred, how many cows will you need to remove in order for the pasture to show growth toward a healthy equilibrium?
