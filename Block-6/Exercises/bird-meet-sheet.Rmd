The dynamical function in the graph is a sixth-order polynomial. It has several fixed points, labelled "a", "b", "c", and so on. 

The numbers i, ii, iii, etc. mark some initial conditions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
g <- makeFun((x-2.5)*(x-5)*(7.5+x)*(2.5 + x)*(x+9.1)*(x-9.5)/10000 ~ x)
Inits <- tibble(
  x = c(-10, -8, -5.7, -4, -2, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10),
  y = 0,
  L = c("i", "ii", "iii", "iv", "v", "vi", "vii", "viii", "iv", "v")
)
Zeros <- tibble(
  x = c(-9.1, -7.5, -2.5, 2.5, 5, 9.5),
  y = 0.3*c(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -5),
  L = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f")
)
slice_plot(g(x) ~ x, domain(x=-10:10)) %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept= ~ 0, color="brown", size=2, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "f(x)") %>%
  gf_text(y ~ x, label=~L, data = Inits, inherit=FALSE) %>%
  gf_text(y ~ x, label=~L, data = Zeros, color="magenta", inherit=FALSE)
```

For each of the initial conditions marked in the graph, say whether the long-term behavior of the trajectory from that point will lead to one of the fixed points (and which one) or to $-\infty$ or $\infty$. (Hint: That the function is a sixth-order polynomial should tell you something about the functions behavior beyond the domain shown in the graph.)
