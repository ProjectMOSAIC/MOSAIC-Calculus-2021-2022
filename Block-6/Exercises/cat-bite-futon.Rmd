For the following,  you can use whatever you like for function names, e.g. $f_1(), f_x(), g(), h(), h_3()$ and so on. Indicate the names of function inputs by writing them explicitly inside the parentheses in the normal way, e.g. $g_2(u, v, w)$.

1. Write down the framework for a system of differential equations with state variables $u, v, w$.

2. Write down the framework for a system of differential equations with state $z, u$.

3. Write down the framework for a system of differential equations with state variables $v, x, z$.

<!-- For instance for #3:
$$\partial_t v = f(v, x, z)\\
\partial_t x = g(v, x, z)\\
\partial_t z = h(v, x, z)$$
