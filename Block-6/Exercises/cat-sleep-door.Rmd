Section \@ref(ballistics) gives the equations for the motion of a cannonball with a simple model of air resistance and shows how to integrate them numerically with `integrateODE()`.

You task is to set the initial conditions for velocity so that the ball is being fired 250 feet per second at an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal. These initial conditions will be
$v_0 = 250 \sin\left(\strut \pi \theta/180\right)$ and
$u_0 = 250 \cos\left(\strut \pi \theta/180\right)$, where $\theta$ has units of degrees.  


Once you have the numerical integration working, find an argmin for $\theta$ that maximizes the horizontal distance travelled by the cannonball.
