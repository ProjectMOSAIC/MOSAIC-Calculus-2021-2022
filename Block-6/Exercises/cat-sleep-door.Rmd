Launch the cannon ball with an upward vertical component of velocity, that is, with the initial velocity vector at angle $\theta$ from the horizontal. You can model this by setting the initial $v_0 = 250 \sin\left(\strut \pi \theta/180\right)$ and
$u_0 = 250 \cos\left(\strut \pi \theta/180\right)$, where $\theta$ has units of degrees.  FIND THE $\theta$ that maximizes the horizontal distance traveled.
