Some of these are first-order differential equations, others are not. For each, say whether it is indeed a first-order differential equation and, if so, what is the name of the state variable.

1. $\partial_t u = f(t)$ <!-- RHS is not function of u -->
2. $\partial_x y = g(x)$ <!-- RHS is not function of y -->
3. $\partial_t z = h(z)$ <!-- z is the state variable -->
4. $\partial_x y = f_2(y)$ <!-- y is the state variable -->
5. $\partial_t t = 1$ <!-- just an ordinary derivative -->
6. $\partial_t u = g_2(u) + g_3(u)$ <!-- u is the state variable -->
