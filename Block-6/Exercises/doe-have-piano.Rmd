Coffee at an initial temperature of $T=$ 80 degrees C is in a closed thermos at a (very cold) construction site where the ambient temperature is -20 C. Suppose, with the thermos closed, it takes 4 hours for the coffee to fall to a tepid 30 degrees C. The thermos cools in accord with Newton's Law of Cooling.

Draw a quantitatively reasonable graph of the dynamical function consistent with these facts in the differential equation $$\partial_t T = f(T)\ .$$


<!-- The fixed point will be at -20 C. To judge from the time the coffee takes to fall from 80 degrees C have of the way to -20 C, the half-life of cooling is 4 hours. 

This gives us the exponential form $e^{-a t}$ where $a$ is such that
$e^{-4 a} = 0.5$, with the units of 4 in hours and $a$ in hours^-1^. The numerical value of $a$ is therefore 0.173 per hour and the dynamical function will be $$f(t) \equiv 0.173(T + 20)\ .$$
