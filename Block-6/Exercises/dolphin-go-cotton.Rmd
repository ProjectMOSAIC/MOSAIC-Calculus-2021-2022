In the rabbit/fox system, the quantity
$$Q(R, F) = \delta R - \gamma \ln(R) + \beta F - \alpha \ln(F)$$ is conserved.

This means that each of the level curves (contours) in the contour plot of $Q(R, F)$ is follows the path of a trajectory. 

1. Make a contour plot of $Q(R, F)$ over the domain $0.1 \leq R \leq 3$, $0 \leq F \leq 2$ for $\alpha=.66, \beta = 1.33, \gamma=1, \delta = 1$.

2. From the graph you made in (1), choose an appropriate initial condition that falls on one of the contours.

3. Using `integrateODE()`, find the trajectory from from the initial condition in (1) for `tdur=10`. Add a layer to the graphic in (1) showing the trajectory to confirm that the conserved quantities are indeed conserved.

4. Symbolically, calculate $\partial_t Q(R, V)$. You will need to use the chain rule, which will leave you with terms $\partial_t R$ and $\partial_t F$. Plug in the values for these from the differential equations and show that $\partial_t Q(R, V) = 0$. 

<!-- Solution to 1-3 -->
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
T <- integrateODE(
  dR ~ 0.66*R - 1.33*R*F, 
  dF ~ -1*F + 1*R*F,
  R = 3, F=0.5, tdur=10)
V <- makeFun(1*R - 1*log(R) + 1.33*F - 0.66*log(F) ~ R & F)
contour_plot(V(R, F) ~ R & F, domain(R = .1:3, F=0:2), skip=0,
             contours_at = c(1.6, 1.7, 1.9, 2, 2.15, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3, 4)) %>%
  streamlines(
              dR ~ 0.66*R - 1.33*R*F, 
              dF ~ -1*F + 1*R*F, 
              domain=domain(R = .1:3, F=0:2), npts=15) %>%
  traj_plot(F(t) ~ R(t), T)
```
