Answer these questions with respect to Figure \@ref(fig:road-rules).

```{r drive1-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "At mile marker 4, which way is the car going?",
  "+West+" = "A negative velocity means heading west.",
  "East",
  "At a standstill"
)
```

```{r drive1-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "How long will it take for the car to go from mile marker 4 to mile marker 0? (Choose the closest answer.)",
  "5 minutes",
  "15 minutes",
  "+25 minutes+" = "The velocity is about -10 mph over that segment of the road. To go 4 miles at 10 mph takes 24 minutes.",
  "45 minutes",
  "Can't be done.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r drive1-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "A car starts at mile marker 8. Where will it end up?",
  "+All the way west+",
  "About mile 9",
  "About mile 10",
  "About mile 13",
  "All the way east",

```{r drive1-5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "You and your friend plan to bike along the road. (Bikes are not covered by the speed mandate.) You'll stop at a point where you can sell snacks to motorists through their car windows. What's the most profitable point for you to set up your business.",

A government commission is exploring ways to improve road use by changing the speed mandate. They will add a constant to the existing speed mandate.

```{r drive1-6, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "One group of citizens wants to facilitate east-to-west travel. Which of these would be a suitable value of the constant to add to the speed mandate?",
  "+-75 mph+",
  "-25 mph",
  "15 mph",
  "35 mph",
  "60 mph",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r drive1-7, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Another group of citizens wants to facilitate west-to-east travel. Which of these would be a suitable value of the constant to add to the speed mandate?",
  "-75 mph",
  "-25 mph",
  "15 mph",
  "35 mph",
  "+60 mph+",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r drive1-8, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "An angry chef has a road-side hamburger stand at mile 5. His business has been non-existent since the current speed mandate was implemented. To give his stand the best chance at success, which policy should he advocate?",
  "-75 mph",
  "-25 mph",
  "+15 mph+",
  "35 mph",
  "60 mph",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
