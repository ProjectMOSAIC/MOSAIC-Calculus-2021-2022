This needs re-organization. The 2-dimensional state space is awkward. There needs also to be a withdrawal policy that makes sense. 
:::


There are two basic forms of retirement plan: a ***pension*** and an ***individual retirement account*** (IRA). The dynamics are the same for both: $$\partial_t V = r V + M\ .$$ The major differences are who makes the contribution and what will be the monthly payout.

In an individual retirement account, the retiree withdraws money from the account at whatever rate seems appropriate. Sensible people make a plan for withdrawals so that their savings will last them for the rest of their life. A rule of thumb is to withdraw a fraction of the principal equal to their age divided by 1000. Thus, a 70-year old would withdraw about $70/1000 = 0.07 = 7\%$ per year. Sensible people also keep their savings invested in some secure way such as government bonds. As of the start of 2022, 10-year US treasury bonds pay about 1.8% per year, although at the start of 2021 the rate was 1% per year.

Let $S(\text{age})$ stand for the amount of savings at a given age, 
then the dynamics are $$\partial_{\text{age}} S = - \underbrace{\frac{\text{age}}{1000} S}_{\text{rate of withdrawal}} + \underbrace{0.018 S}_{\text{investment gains}}\ .$$ If the age at retirement were 65,  initial condition is $S(65) =$accumulated retirements savings.

Notice that the dynamical function, involves two inputs: the amount of savings $S$ and the age of the retiree. This means that the dynamical state has two components: $S$ and age. So we will write the dynamics as two differential equations, one for each component of the state.

$$\partial_{\text{age}} S = -\frac{\text{age}}{1000} S +0.018 S\\
\ \\
\partial_{\text{age}} \text{age} = 1$$

The second equation is so simple that it hardly needs to be given explicitly, but solving differential equations is a matter of careful book-keeping and we need to keep track of the retiree's age at any point in time.

A solution to this dynamical system can be calculated by `integrateODE()`. The initial condition on age is, say, 65. As the initial condition on $S$, 
we'll take an amount from the example in the book: $\928,000.

```{r}
Soln <- integrateODE(dage ~ 1, dS ~ - pmin(((age-10)/1000)*S, 45000) + 0.018*S, 
                     S = 928000, age=65,
                     tdur = 50)
Assets <- makeFun(Soln$S(age - 65) ~ 65)


slice_plot(Assets(age) ~ age, domain(age=65:110))
slice_plot(pmin((age-10)/1000 * Assets(age), 45000) ~ age, domain(age=65:110))
```
