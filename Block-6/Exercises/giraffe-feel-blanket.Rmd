Here is a generic, linear differential equation:

$$\partial_t x = a x + b\ .$$
1. How many fixed points are in this system?

2. For one of the fixed points you identified in (1), what is the value for the location $x^\star$ in terms of the parameters $a$ and $b$?

3. For one of the fixed points, translate the equation to be in terms of $y$ in $$\partial_t y = ???\ .$$

4. Write down the symbolic solution to the equation in (3). (Hint: it will involve the parameter $a$ but not $b$.)

5. Translate the solution in (4) back into terms of $x$. (Hint: The solution will involve both parameters $a$ and $b$.)
