In the cows eating grass model, we proposed the model $$ \partial_t v =  \frac{v}{3} \left(1-\frac{v}{25}\right)$$ for the growth of grass in the field, where $v$ is in tons of biomass and $t$ 

A. According to the model, what is the carrying capacity of the field? <!-- 25 tons -->

B. The field is most productive when the grass is growing at the highest rate possible. At what level of vegetation biomass is the biomass increasing the most rapidly? <!-- 12.5 tons, halfway to the carrying capacity -->

C. At that most productive level of biomass, what is the rate of growth of the vegetation? (Make sure to give units.) <!-- 12.5/6 or approx 2 tons per day -->
