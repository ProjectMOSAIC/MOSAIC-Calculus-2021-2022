1. Suppose that $p(t)$ is the population density of squirrels over time. Draw the dynamical function $s(p)$ in the differential equation $$\partial_t p = s(p)$$ that will produce a population that grows form a very small density of 4 squirrels per hectare to a carrying capacity of 50 squirrels per hectare. Mark the units on your graph.

2. Challenge: Arrange the units on the output of $s(p)$ so that it will take roughly 3 months to reach the carrying capacity.
