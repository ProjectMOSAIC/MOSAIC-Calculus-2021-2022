For the two-state variable linear dynamical system
$$\begin{array}{c}\partial_t x  = ax  +  b y \\ \partial_t y = c x +  dy\end{array} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\c & d\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{c}x\\y\end{array}\right]$$
the solution can be written as a linear combination of exponentials
$$x(t) = A e^{\lambda_1 t} + B e^{\lambda_2 t}\ .$$
For each of the following systems and initial conditions, find the coefficients $A$ and $B$.

1. $\left[\begin{array}{rr}1 & 1\\0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$ with $x(0) = 3$ and $\partial_t x(0) = 1$.

2. $\left[\begin{array}{rr}1 & 1\\0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$ with $x(0) = 3$ and $\partial_t x(0) = -1$.

3. $\left[\begin{array}{rr}1 & 1\\0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$ with $x(0) = -3$ and $\partial_t x(0) = -1$.

4. $\left[\begin{array}{rr}-1 & 1\\0 & -2 \end{array}\right]$ with $x(0) = 0$ and $\partial_t x(0) = 5$.

5. $\left[\begin{array}{rr}-1 & 1\\1 & -2 \end{array}\right]$ with $x(0) = 5$ and $\partial_t x(0) = 0$.
