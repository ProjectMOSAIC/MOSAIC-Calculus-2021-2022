In this exercise, you'll be using an app that allows you to set $a$ and $b$ in the [ab10] matrix and hunt for eigenvectors.

</a>

Open up the app in another browser tab and arrange it side-by-side with this document, so you can see both at the same time.

You used a somewhat similar app when exploring linear, two-dimensional finite-difference equations. [Here's a link](https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/142Z-Matrix-iteration/), but you don't need to open that app for this exercise.

This new app does a few things differently:

* In the old app, you had four number-entry boxes to set the values of the [abcd] matrix. Here, because we're using the [ab10] format, you need only set $a$ and $b$. You can do this by clicking within the left-hand graph.
* The a-b selector graph is annotated with the type of generic behavior that the differential-equation system will show for any combination of $a$ and $b$. This allows you to reason backward from the behavior you are interested in to the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$. Since the type of behavior is encoded in the eigenvalues, you are effectively inverting the eigenvalue formula to find $a$ and $b$.
* The flow field (right-hand graph) shows *stream-lines* of continuous-time motion. Imagine you had a bunch of glitter which you cast out over a pool of water with a given flow pattern. If you took a time-exposure photo, you would see each piece of glitter as it moved along with the water in which it is embedded. 
* You can click in the flow field to start a trajectory at that point. You can control the time domain---that is, how long is the time exposure of the photo---with the radio buttons at the bottom.
* There is a thin, green line annotating the flow field. This line runs from the fixed point (right in the center) in the direction of the point on which you click to start a trajectory. A vector with the same orientation as the green line is given numerically below the graph. This orientation is also described using an angle measurement in degrees.
* There is no display of the *solution*, that is, $x()$ versus $t$. This is because we want you to understand the *geometry* of the flow. 

First, play around with the app. Choose miscellaneous values of $a$ and $b$, observe the flow, and click in the flow field to draw a red trajectory. Notice what happens when you make the number of steps larger or smaller. In unstable directions, you can get a good view of the trajectory by starting it near the fixed point. If you start it at the periphery of the graph, most of the trajectory will be outside the display. And if the number of steps is very small, you may not see it at all because the glyph is so thin near the start.

When coming from a stable direction, click near the periphery of the graph to get a good view, since the red trajectory will naturally be heading in towards the origin. When estimating the orientation of an eigenvector, try to get the green line heading straight down the middle of the red trajectory. This often requires a bit of fiddling, moving the starting point just a tiny amount to find one that is just right.

When you are *on* an eigenvector, the trajectory will be dead straight on the green line. Any trajectory not starting on an eigenvector will be curved to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the relative sizes of the eigenvalues.

In the following questions, pick the choice **closest** to the answer you found. The exact choice of $a$ and $b$ stemming from a click depends somewhat on the graphics resolution of your display, so you should expect only to be able to get close to the $a$ and $b$ values given in the question.
