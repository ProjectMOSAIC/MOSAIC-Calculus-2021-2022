Consider the second-order linear differential equation

$$\partial_{tt}x = - b\ \partial_t x - a\ x$$ where $a$ and $b$ are scalars.

The only state variable listed explicitly in the second-order equation is $x$. 

1. Define a new state variable $v \equiv \partial_t x$ and use it to re-write the second-order equation as **two first-order** differential equations: $$\partial_t v = ????\\\partial_t x = ????$$

2. Confirm that the matrix equivalent to the pair of first order equations is $$\left[\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\1 & 0\end{array}\right]\ .$$

3. With only 2 parameters, $a$ and $b$, can the matrix in (2) create the full range of behaviors seen in the 4-parameter abcd matrix
$$\left[\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\c & d\end{array}\right]\ ?$$

To answer this question, we'll return to the app that displays flows:

You can see in the ab-selector graph on the left annotations for several types of generic behaviour:

- Saddle (unstable along one eigenvector, stable along the other)
- Sources (unstable along both eigenvectors)
- Sinks (stable along both eigenvectors)
- Stable oscillation (spirals toward the fixed point)
- Unstable oscillation (spirals away from the fixed point)

In the ab-selector graph, these are encoded by color and shading. The blue parabola marks the ab-region of oscillation; stability is indicated using dark shading. Saddles are at the top of the ab-graph. Sources and sinks are the gray arches rising up from the edges of the graph. 

The shading is set by calculating the eigenvalues for each (a, b)-pair

**What sorts of trajectories, if any, are not produced by ab10 compared to the possibilities provided by the abcd matrix?**

4. Underneath the graph are two numeric-input widgets, one to set the $c$ parameter, the other to set $d$. By default, these are set to display an [ab10] matrix, but you can change them.

Play with the $c$- and $d$-inputs to see how that changes the flow field (right graph) and the shaded regions. Make small changes to $c$ and $d$ at first to get a feeling for what the controls do to the display. Then you can explore large changes.

**Does any new type of behavior appear when $c$ and $d$ are moved from their [ab10] settings?**
