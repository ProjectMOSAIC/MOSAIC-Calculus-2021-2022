Figure \@ref(fig:cow-consumption) shows a model of a cow's consumption of vegetation as a sigmoidal function of the amount of vegetation. In addition to the mathematics of the function, it's helpful to be able to translate the shape of the function into terms that make sense in the **context** of the model.

```{r cow1, echo=FALSE}
explain <- "The level of hunger can be measured by the slope of the consumption curve. If a cow would eat a lot more if the biomass were available, she must be hungry."
askMC(
  "At what level of available biomass is the cow most hungry at the end of the day? (Hint: Think about how you would measure how hungry a cow is at the end of the day.)",
  "+2 tons+" = "The consumption function is steepest here, meaning that if more grass were available the cow would eat the biggest proportion of it.",
  "5 tons" = explain,
  "10 tons" = explain,
  "15 tons" = "Even if more grass were available, the cow wouldn't each much of it. So, the cow is not very hungry."
)
```
