Consider a dynamical system with state variables $x$ and $y$.

Identify each of these mathematical objects as 
i. a time series
ii. a trajectory
iii. a state space
iv. an instantaneous state
v. nonsense

1. The graph $x(t)$ versus $y(t)$.
2. The graph $x(t)$ versus $t$.
3. The graph $x(y)$ versus $y$.
3. The coordinate $(x=2, y=1)$.
4. The $(x,y)$ coordinate plane.
