In the description of the  SIR model, we pointed out how a model of recovery $\partial_t I = -\alpha I$ differs from the usual "recover after 7 days" style of description. (See Figure \@ref(fig:recovery-pattern).)

Find a value of $\alpha$ such that the ***expectation value*** of the time to recovery is 7 days. To do this:

1. Find a formula for the function $I(t)$ from the differential equation.
2. Guess an appropriate value for $\alpha$.
3. Construct the appropriate integral using $I(t)$ to find the expectation value of $t$. (See Chapter `r Chaps$expectation_value`.)
4. Modify your guess for $\alpha$ until the expectation value comes out to 7.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
expected_value <- function(alpha) {
  f <- makeFun(exp(-alpha*t) ~ t)
  Integrate(t*f(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:1000)) # Note the t multiplying the function
}
Zeros(expected_value(t) - 7 ~ t, domain(t=.2:1))
```
