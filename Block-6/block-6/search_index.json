[["dynamics-draft.html", "Chapter 41 Dynamics", " Chapter 41 Dynamics Introduction to dynamics Objectives/topics:  Explain the format in which we present dynamics as opposed to trajectories Find qualitative solutions from an initial condition Articulate the difference between state, dynamics, and trajectory May’s Cows Objectives/topics Classify fixed points as stable/unstable given the dynamics Identify the dynamics of constant growth Compute Euler solutions (format for expressing the system and the format of the result) Analyze models in application contexts (for example May’s Cows - a model of bistability in ecology) Linearization Objectives/topics Linear expansion around a fixed point Qualitative solution to exponential growth Understand that growth involves exponentials Impulse response and convolution (?) Bang/bang control theory (?) Systems of nonlinear differential equations Objectives/topics Understand the format of presentations of dynamics (vector fields) and trajectories ( x vs t, y i. vs t or phase plane) Finding solutions graphically (flow fields) Dependence on initial condition Models leading to flow fields Objectives/topics Apply modeling techniques (from block 2) local low order polynomials Predatory/Prey (flow fields and the phenomena of the trajectories) SIR (flow fields and the phenomena of the trajectories) The differences between these two models Additional models and flow fields (catch up day) Objectives/topics (Richardson’s arms race model and conflict model, action potentials) Numerics, look at the trajectories Analysis of phase plane with nullclines Fixed points of nonlinear systems in the phase plane Objectives/topics Determine fixed points and linearize the system around the fixed points Flow field of the linear approximation Matrix representation of the flow field Iteration of matrices Eigenvalue/Eigenvector analysis Objectives/topics Understand the geometry of the flow (what an eigenvector looks like in terms of the flow, as it emerges from the image of the flow field) Trajectories as linear combinations of eigenflows Classification of fixed points Calculus of second order differential equations Objectives/topics Force balance equations Equivalence to phase plane description Exponential Ansatz (solution is made up of exponentials, which one?) Complex eigenvalues Harmonic Oscillator Objectives/topics Complex exponentials and their equivalency to sinusoids Sinusoids with exponential amplitudes (damping) Relation to the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues Forcing and resonance "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
