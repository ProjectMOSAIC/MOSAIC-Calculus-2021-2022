We've discussed ***shifting the baseline*** of the exponential and sinusoid functions by adding a constant to the basic modeling function, like this:`r mark(864)`

$$f(t) \equiv A e^{kt} + C\\
\ \\
g(t) \equiv A \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P} t\right) + C$$

We've called this output scaling. It's an example of a much more general and powerful way of contructing modeling functions called ***linear combinations***.

In a linear combination, you start with one or more basic functions. For discussion, let's call these $f_1(t)$, $f_2(t)$, $f_3(t)$ and so on. In making a linear combination, multiply each of the basic functions by some quantity and add the results together:

$$\text{linear combination of}\ f_1(t)\ \text{and}\ f_2(t): \ \ A_1 f_1(t) + A_2 f_2(t)$$
The quantities $A_1$ and $A_2$ are called ***scalars*** because they **scale** the functions. (In Chapter \@ref(vectors) you will see that we make a distinction between a **scalar**, which is a single quantity, and a **vector**, which is a set of scalars.)

It's common to take linear combinations of functions with different inputs, for example
$$h(x, y, t) \equiv 4 e^{-kt} + 7 y + 2\,\pnorm(x-3) - 19$$

In fields like statistics and economics and other social sciences, as well as clinical medical research, a great number of modeling techniques involve such combinations of functions of various inputs. `r mark(866)`

In engineering and physics, an important class of functions involves a linear combination of many sinusoids of different periods, e.g. 

$$\text{signal}(t) \equiv A_1 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P_1}t\right) + 
A_2 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P_2}t\right) + 
A_3 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P_3}t\right) + \cdots$$

Linear combination of functions provides a powerful and flexible general-purpose modeling technique in part because many physical systems seem to work this way and in part because the methods for finding the scalars---$A_1$, $A_2$, and so on---have an extremely strong theory and fast computer implementations that automatically solve the problem once the modeler has selected the functions she wants to combine. In Block 4, we use the name ***target problem*** to refer the problem of finding scalars to match as well as possible a linear combination to data.

An expression like $A e^{kx} + C$ combines the exponential (obviously!) and a second function that isn't immediately obvious: the constant function $\text{constant}(x) \equiv 1$. It might be overkill to re-write the expression as $A e^{kx} + C\, \text{constant}(x)$ but get in the habit of seeing the constant function as a constant presence in linear combinations!

Polynomials are an important example of linear combinations. Something like $p(x) \equiv a + b t + c t^2$ is a linear combination of the constant function, the proportional function, and the square function. 

## Functions with multiple inputs

We can use ***linear combination*** and ***function multiplication*** to build up custom functions from the basic modeling functions. Similarly, linear combination and function multiplication provide ways to construct functions of multiple inputs. `r mark(1400)` 

## f(x) times g(t)

For example, when a guitar string is at rest it forms a straight line connecting its two fixed ends: one set by finger pressure along the neck of the guitar and the other at the bridge near the center of the guitar body. When a guitar string is plucked, its oscillations follow a sinusoid pattern of **displacement**. With the right camera and lighting setup, we can see these oscillations in action:

For a string of length $L$, the string displacement is a function of position $x$ along the string and is a linear combination of functions of the form $$g_k(x) \equiv \sin(k \pi x /L)$$ where $k$ is an integer.  A few of these functions are graphed in Figure \@ref(fig:guitar-string-modes) with $k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=3$.

```{r guitar-string-modes, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Vibrational modes of a guitar string."}
slice_plot(sin(pi*x/100) ~ x, domain(x=c(0, 100)), 
           label_text = "k=1") %>% 
  slice_plot(sin(2* pi*x/100) ~ x, color="dodgerblue",
             label_text="k=2", label_x = 0.95) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3* pi*x/100) ~ x, color="green",
             label_text="k=3", label_x = 0.90) %>%
  gf_labs(x="", y="", title="Three modes of a guitar string.")
string_shape <- function(x, t) {
  sin(pi*x/100)*sin(pi*t) - 2*sin(2*pi*x/100)*sin(2*pi*t) - 1.5*sin(3*pi*x/100)*sin(3*pi*t)
}

slice_plot(
  string_shape(x, t=pi/2) ~ x,
  domain(x=c(0,100))
) %>%
  gf_labs(x="Position along string (%)", y="Side-to-side displacement (mm) ", title="A linear combination of the modes")
```

Shapes of the sort in Figure \@ref(fig:guitar-string-modes) are a stop-motion flash snapshot of the string. The string's shape also changes in time, so the string's displacement is a function of both $x$ and $t$. The displacement itself is a sinusoid whose time period depends on the length and tension of the string as well as the number of cycles of the spatial sine: 
$$g_k(x, t) \equiv \sin(\frac{k \pi}{L} x) \ \sin(\frac{k \pi}{P}t)$$ Figure \@ref(fig:string-motion) shows a few snapshots of the 1.5 cycle string at different moments in time, and the motion of the linear combination.`r mark(1410)` 

```{r string-motion, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="String position changes over time."}
slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.5) ~ x, 
           domain(x=c(0,100))) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.6) ~ x, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  slice_plot(sin(3*pi*x/100) * sin(.7) ~ x, alpha = 0.25) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Shape at three different instants",
          x = "", y="Side-to-side displacement")
slice_plot(string_shape(x, .5) ~ x, domain(x=c(0,100))) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .525) ~ x, alpha = 0.7) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .55) ~ x, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .575) ~ x, alpha = 0.37) %>%
  slice_plot(string_shape(x, .6) ~ x, alpha = 0.25) %>%
  gf_labs(y="Side-to-side displacement (mm)",
          x = "Position along string (%)",
          title="Linear combination of vibrating modes at different times.")
```

We left function ***composition*** out of the list of ways to build multivariable functions out of simpler functions with a single input.  

For instance, consider the two functions $f(x)$ and $g(t)$. The composition $f(g(t))$ has only **one** input: $t$. Similarly, $g(f(x))$ has only one input: $x$.
