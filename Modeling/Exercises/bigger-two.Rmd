The function `bigger()` is defined piecewise in terms of two extremely simple functions. Each of the two simple functions has a contour plot with contours that are parallel. The piecewise combination of the simple functions has a more complicated contour plot, with each simple function's parallel contours showing up in half of the domain. We'll call these "pieces" of the domain.


```{r}
bigger <- makeFun(ifelse(y > x, y, x) ~ x + y)
contour_plot(bigger(x,y) ~ x+y, domain(x=c(-2,2), y=c(-2,2)))
```

```{r bg2-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of the following best describes the two pieces of the domain?",
  "+One is above and to the left of the line of identity (that is, $y=x$) and the other is below and to the right of that line.+",
  "One is $x > 0$ and the other $x \\leq 0$",
  "One is $x > 0$ and the other $y \\leq 0$"
)
```
