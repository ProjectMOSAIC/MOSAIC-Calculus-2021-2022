::: {.underconstruction}
Make this about identifying the functions being composed, multiplied, or linearly combined.

## All together now!

Two or all three of the techniques for combining functions---linear combinations, function composition, and function multiplication---can be used in the same function.

Consider the function for the length of the day
$$\text{daylight}(L, \delta) \equiv \frac{2}{15} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(\delta)\right)$$
The 2/15 is scaling the output of $\arccos()$. The $\arccos()$ is being composed with an interior function that is itself a scaled product of two functions.
