Here is a plot of the power output (BHP) versus displacement (in cc) of 39 internal combustion engines.

::: {.scaffolding  data-latex=""}
```{r}
gf_point(BHP ~ displacement, data = Engines) %>%
  gf_lims(y  = c(0, 30000))
```
:::

```{r EM1-1, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Your study partner claims that the smallest engine in the data has a displacement of 2000 cc (that is, 2.0 liters) and 100 horsepower. Based only on the graph, is this claim plausible?",
    "+Yes, because 2000  cc and 100 hp would look like (0, 0) on  the scale of this graph.+" = "",
    "Yes, because that size engine is typical for a small car." = "That may be, but certainly you've encountered lawn  mower engines that are much smaller.",
    "No, the smallest engine is close to 0 cc." = "Would you  be able to distinguish visually an engine of 1 cc from an engine of 1000cc on this graph? Both these values would lie on the same horizontal pixel in the graph.",
    "No, my study partner is always wrong." = "Be that as it may, we're looking for a principled answer, not an *ad hominem* one."
)
```

**Semi-log scales**

The next command will make a graph of the same engine data as before, but with a log scale on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is still linear. 

```{r}
gf_point(BHP ~ displacement, data = Engines) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_log10())
```

```{r EM1-2, echo=FALSE}
askMC(
  prompt = "Using just the graph, answer this question: The engines range over how many decades of displacement? (Remember, a decade is a factor of 10.)",
    "+7 decades+" = "",
    "Can't tell" = "Yes, you can. Figure out what one decade corresponds to in terms of distance on  the log axes.",
    "$10^7$ decades" = "The estimated volume of the entire universe is about $4 \\times 10^{86}$ cc. The volume of a neutron is about $6 \\times 10^{-81}$ cc. The range between a neutron and the universe is therefore about $86  - -81 = 167$ decades. Do you think it likely that there is an internal combustion engine smaller than a neutron or larger than the universe?",
    "About 3.5 decades" = "Perhaps you're treating the distance between axis labels as one decade. Look carefully and you see that it's actually a factor of 100, that is, two decades."
