The graph comes from an online guide, "[Retirement Income Analysis with Scenario Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Sharpe)," published in 2019 by [William F. Sharpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Sharpe), winner of the Nobel Prize in economices in 1990. The guide is intended to be of interest to those planning for retirement income who also happen to have a sophisticated understanding of mathematics and computing. You may or may not be in the former group, but it is hoped that, as you follow this course, you are becoming a member of the later group.

```{r mort-age, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mortality rates for people aged 50+ in the US in 2009. The mortality rate is the probability of dying in one year. It's shown here as a function of age and sex."}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/rismat-mortality.png"))
```
As you can see, the graph shows nearly parallel straight-line functions for both women and men, with women somewhat less likely than men to die at any given age.

  "+About 40% lower than men.+" = "Women have a mortality rate of 1% while the rate for men is just under 2%.",

  "105 years",
  "+110 years+",
  "120 years",
  "130 years",

  "A straight-line function with positive slope.",
  "A power-law with a positive exponent." = "That would be a straight line on log-log axes.",
  "+An exponentially increasing function with a horizontal asymptote at mortality = 0.+" = "A straight-line on semi-log axes---what we have here---is diagnostic of an exponential function. The function value would go to zero for age = $- \\infty$, but that mathematical fact is hardly relevant to human lifespan.",
  "An exponentially decaying function, with a horizontal asymptote at mortality = 100%.",
