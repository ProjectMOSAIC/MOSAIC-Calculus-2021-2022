The map shows the path of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 as it moved over Jamaica to Alabama to Virginia to Florida to Texas.

i. For the path, is the latitude a function of the longitude? 
  
ii. Is the longitude a function of the latitude? 
  
iii. There is a point in the Gulf of Mexico that Ivan traversed twice. Does this mean the latitude is **not** a function of time?
