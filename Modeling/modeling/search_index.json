Of course, the output from function \\(f(x)\\) will be \\(f(x=A)\\) and \\(f(x=B)\\) respectively. The rate-of-change relationship is the ratio \\[\\frac{\\color{red}{f(x=B) - f(x=A)}}{\\color{blue}{B-A}}\\ \\ \\text{also written}\\ \\ \\frac{\\color{red}{\\text{rise}}}{\\color{blue}{\\text{run}}}\\] Why do we focus on the rate of change rather than something simpler, for example the net change \\(\\color{red}{f(x=B) - f(x=A)}\\)? The reason goes back to a scientific breakthrough in the 1600s: the writing down of the Newton’s laws of motion. The language in which these laws were first successfully expressed is the language of rates of change. In the intervening 400 years, the laws have been updated with the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. These laws too are expressed as rates of change. In undertaking to study just about any quantitative field from engineering to economics you’ll find that theory is expressed using functions and rates of change. You may recognize in the formula for the rate of change a familiar quantity: the slope of a line. Everyone understands what a line is, but the geometry is not our primary concern here. We describe relationships using functions and for us the straight-line function will be a fundamental way of expressing a relationship. Straight-line functions can be written in several ways, but we’ll tend to use two predominant forms: \\[\\line(x) \\equiv a x + b\\ \\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\line(x) \\equiv a [x - x_0]\\] The two forms are interchangeable, but as you’ll see in upcoming chapters, sometimes it’s more convenient to use one form or the other. In either case, the rate of change is, quantitatively, the value of the parameter \\(a\\). The simple function \\(\\line(x)\\), whose change relationship we understand intuitively, will be used to approximate more complicated change relationships. With the approximation in place, we can do calculations about the change relationships much more easily. Collectively, the set of mathematical concepts and techniques that support describing and calculating on change relationships has the name Calculus.
