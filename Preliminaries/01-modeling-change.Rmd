A major use for mathematics is building models, representation for a purpose, constructed out of mathematical things some of which we describe in the next section.

Models are easy to manipulate compared to reality, easy to implement (think "draw a blueprint" versus "construct a building"), and easy to extract information from. We can build multiple models and compare and contrast them to gain insight to the real-world situation behind the models.

## Quantity vs number 

## Functions

input & output, domain & range,

pattern-book functions

## Spaces

Number line, coordinate plane, x,y,z-space, and upward.
