## Objects

- scalar quantity,
- functions,
- defining functions in math notation
- future objects: paths, surfaces, directions, subspaces, constraints

About defining functions as $f(x) \equiv m x + b$ add this:
Notice that we're using $\equiv$ (with three parallel bars) rather than $=$. Pronounce $\equiv$ as "***is defined to be***," or "***equiv***" for short. There's no $y$. The $x$ appears in parentheses on the left side of $\equiv$ to say explicitly "$x$ stands for the input." The notation provides a place to state the ***name*** of the function, in this case $g()$, so that we can refer to the function unambiguously when we are doing operations on it. Since often we'll be using many functions at the same time, it's helpful to have a way to distinguish them by name. The functional notation makes it easy to create many different names, e.g.  $g_\star()$, $h_\text{altitude}()$, azimuth(), and so on. The high-school habit of using $y$ doesn't give such flexibility.

## R/mosaic

- assignment
- formulas and tilde-expressions
- functions from formulas: `makeFun()`
- examples other ways to make functions
- functions to scalars: `Zeros`, `ArgM`
