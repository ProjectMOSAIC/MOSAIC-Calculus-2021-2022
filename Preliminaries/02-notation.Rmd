**IN DRAFT: There are two similar sections in Version 1 of the book. Reconcile and merge them here.**

## Section 1

You have grown up with traditional mathematical notation and are likely familiar with the notation for several of the pattern-book functions: $\ln x$, $\sin x$, $e^x$, $x^p$ (as in $x^2$ where $p=2$ or $\sqrt{x}$ where $p=1/2$). `r mark(450)`

Traditional notation mixes up several things that computer notation sensibly keeps separate. From the computer programmer's point of view, traditional notation is idiosyncratic rather than systematic. 

If you are interested in these things, three concepts from computing may help you appreciate the the differences:

- ***Functional notation*** In computing, the notation in which a function **name** is followed by parentheses^[Or sometimes square braces or curly braces or another token, depending on the language.] with the inputs **inside** the parentheses is called "functional notation." For instance, `exp(x)` is functional notation, since the input `x` is between parentheses. Traditional mathematical notation sometimes leaves out the parentheses, as in $\sin \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\ln 10$. But in this course I always include the parentheses, which are abolutely required in the computer notation, in the traditional notation as well, i.e. $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$.


- ***Infix notation*** For functions with two inputs, computing languages often support a different arrangement of the function name and the inputs where the name comes inbetween the arguments. You've seen this "infix" notation in parts of traditional arithmetic notation, for instance, $3 + 5$ or $8/2$. In R, power-law functions are often written in infix notation, e.g. `3^2` or `x^3`. When you see a traditional notation like $e^x$, you will be tempted at first to write this as `e^x`. But in R, the exponential function is written in functional notation: `exp(x)`.

- ***Markup notation*** You are undoubtedly familar with word processing and, particularly, a style of word processing called What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG). In WYSIWYG, you can enter plain text just using the keyboard, but if you want to make something **boldface** or *italics*, you use the mouse to select the text involved and select a style from a menu. Typically, WYSIWYG mathematical content involves a similar mouse-based process. In contrast, in mainstream computer languages, the mouse is not needed at all. The computer commands are constructed from plain, linear sequences of letters and other characters. 

Traditional mathematical notation includes features such as superscripts and special symbols that are easily written out with pencil in hand. Often this notation is beautiful and aesthetically cherished by mathematicians. But computer commands in most computer languages are straight sequences of characters using function or infix notation.^[Some computer languages use notation where the name of the function is contained inside the parentheses as in `(+ 2 3)`.]






## Section 2

You're familiar with certain styles of mathematical notation, for example:
- The expression $m x + b$ uses a multiplication and an addition. 
- $\sqrt{\strut 1 - x^2}$ uses squaring ($x^2$), subtraction and square root. 
- $3\sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P} x\right) + 4$ uses multiplications, division, sine function, and an addition.

We'll continue to use this style ..... But none of the above examples will work in a mainstream computing language. And computers are essential to modern technical work. So we need to forge a link between traditional mathematical notation---which you'll encounter in most textbooks---and the notation used in computing. We'll do this in two ways:

1. Explain some principles of computer notation and show you how traditional mathematical notation violates these principles.

2. Use a style of mathematical notation that, whenever possible, makes an explicit connection to computer notation.

 

## Objects

- scalar quantity,
- functions,
- defining functions in math notation
- future objects: paths, surfaces, directions, subspaces, constraints

About defining functions as $f(x) \equiv m x + b$ add this:
Notice that we're using $\equiv$ (with three parallel bars) rather than $=$. Pronounce $\equiv$ as "***is defined to be***," or "***equiv***" for short. There's no $y$. The $x$ appears in parentheses on the left side of $\equiv$ to say explicitly "$x$ stands for the input." The notation provides a place to state the ***name*** of the function, in this case $g()$, so that we can refer to the function unambiguously when we are doing operations on it. Since often we'll be using many functions at the same time, it's helpful to have a way to distinguish them by name. The functional notation makes it easy to create many different names, e.g.  $g_\star()$, $h_\text{altitude}()$, azimuth(), and so on. The high-school habit of using $y$ doesn't give such flexibility.

## R/mosaic

- assignment
- formulas and tilde-expressions
- functions from formulas: `makeFun()`
- examples other ways to make functions
- functions to scalars: `Zeros`, `ArgM`

## Inputs

Since the inputs to functions are **quantities**, it's convenient to give them names that remind the human reader what they stand for.

The most common name we will use in this book for an input to a function will be:

- $\large x$ a general-purpose name that complies with the practice in high-school algebra. Remember, for us $x$ is not an "unknown" as it so often is in algebra; in calculus $x$ is the name of an input. 

Perhaps next most common as an input name is 

- $\large t$. This name is typically used when the input is meant to be ***time***. So if we were creating a function to represent the relationship between time (of day) and outdoor brightness, we might use this notation: $\text{brightness}(t)$

Other input names we will use in this book are $y$, $z$, $u$, $v$, $w$. But we won't shy away from more descriptive names, like $T$ for "temperature" or $V$ for volume, or even $\text{altitude}$ (which describes itself). 


## Parentheses

::: {.why  data-latex=""}
In writing $\line(x) \equiv a [x - x_0]$ I used ***square braces*** $\left[\strut\ \right]$ rather than parentheses $\left(\strut\ \right)$ to surround $x - x_0$. Either could be used and there is no difference in meaning. In traditional mathematical notation, either serves to demarcate a sub-expression. We'll be using parentheses very extensively in expressions like $\line(x)$, so it's nice to have a visual break.

## Formulas in R

<!-- moved two exercise files inline: 
chicken-chew-screen.Rmd (was exercise 3.6)
dolphin-toss-candy.Rmd (was 3.7) -->

You're familiar to some extent with traditional mathematical notation for formulas. Yet in applied work, you will often need to translate such formulas into computer notation. This book is written using R, but particularly when mathematical formulas are involved, commands are similar across many computer languages, so what you learn will be applicable to any other languages such as Python or MATLAB.

The first high-level computer language was FORTRAN, released in 1957. The name stands for "formula translation." FORTRAN enabled arithmetic operations to be written in a way very nearly that of traditional notation. Until then, computer programs were written using alpha-numeric codes that were meaningless to a casual reader. We unfortunately still use the term "computer code" to refer to programs, despite 70-years progress in improving legibility. 

The best way to learn to implement mathematical formulas in a computer language is to read examples and practice writing them. 

Here are some examples:

Traditional notation | R notation 
---------------------|-------------
$3 + 2$              | `3 + 2`
$3 \div 2$           | `3 / 2`
$6 \times 4$         | `6 * 4`
$\sqrt{\strut4}$     | `sqrt(4)`
$\ln 5$              | `log(5)`
$2 \pi$              | `2 * pi`
$\frac{1}{2} 17$     | `(1 / 2) * 17`
$17 - 5 \div 2$      | `17 - 5 / 2`
$\frac{17 - 5}{\strut 2}$   | `(17 - 5) / 2`
$3^2$                | `3^2`
$e^{-2}$             | `exp(-2)`


Each of these examples has been written using numbers as inputs to the mathematical operations. The syntax will be exactly the same when using an input name such as `x` or `y` or `altitude`, for instance `(x - y) / 2`. In order for that command using `x` and `y` to work, some meaning must have been previously attached to the symbols. We'll come back to this important topic on another day.

Read through the above table of examples several times. Note down any that you find at all confusing. Then cover up the right side of the table and write down the R expression for each item on the left side. Similarly, cover up the left side of the table and translate the R expression into traditional notation.

::: {.scaffolding  data-latex=""}
Open a `r sandbox_link()` and, one at a time, write and run the R expression for each of these traditional-notation expressions. We give the numerical result for each of the traditional expressions to let you confirm that your R version is correct.

i. $(16 - 3)/2$ gives result `r (16-3)/2`
ii. $\sqrt{\frac{19}{3}}$ gives `r sqrt(19/3)`
iii. $\cos(\frac{2 \pi}{3})$ gives `r cos(2 * pi / 3)`
iv. $\pi^3 + 2$ gives `r pi^3 + 2`
v. $\pi^{3+2}$ gives `r pi^(3+2)`

:::

Once you have a grasp of how to render traditional-notation formulas into R, read these few principles to help consolidate your understanding.

i. Computer languages generally, and R in particular, involve expressions that are written in a typewriter format: one conventional character after another in a straight line. There are no superscripts or subscripts used. So, $\frac{1}{3}$ will be written `1/3`. The equivalent of $\sqrt{7}$ is `sqrt(7)`.
ii. Parentheses:
    a. When an opening parenthesis directly follows a name, as in `sqrt(`, it means that the named operation is to be ***applied*** to the quantity inside the parentheses. So `sqrt(7)` means "take the square root of 7" and `log(10)` means "take the (natural) logarithm of 10." The common mathematical functions typically take only one input. We'll stick with those for now.
    b. When an opening parenthesis does not directly follow a name, as in `6 - (2+3)`, the parentheses stand for ***grouping*** in exactly the same way as in traditional notation. For instance, $(6 + 15) / 3$ is translated as `(6 + 15) / 3`.
iii. Multiplication and exponentiation are often written traditionally in terms of the relative position of quantities. So $(3 + 2)\pi$ means to multiply 5 times $\pi$, even though there is no multiplication sign being written. Similar, $\pi^{3 + 2}$ means to raise $\pi$ to the fifth power. There is no "exponentiation sign" used, just the positioning of $3+2$ as a superscript: $^{3+2}$. In R (and almost every computer language) multiplication and exponentiation **must be written explicitly**. The quantities $(3 + 2)\pi$ and $\pi^{3 + 2}$ would be translated as `(3 + 2) * pi` and `pi^(3+2)`. 
    
One additional note: All these examples can be written with a single line of code, as is true for many short formulas. Later on, we'll encounter longer formulas that *could* be written on a single line but are more readable when spread over two or more consecutive lines. 

## Algorithms

The word used to describe the internals of a computer function is ***algorithm***, which is a generalization of "formula" that includes many non-arithmetic operations such as looping and branching.
