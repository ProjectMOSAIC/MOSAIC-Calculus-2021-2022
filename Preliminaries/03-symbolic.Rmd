Go over the necessary algebra:

- Finding the zero-crossing of a straight-line function
- exponentials and logarithms
- power-law
- sinusoids


Computer notation for the power-law and proportional functions is different because the body of these functions is so short. So instead of using parentheses to apply a named function, invoking the power-law or proportional functions is done using a syntax like `x^p` or `x` or `z^4`.^[If you insist on using a named function for power-law and proportional functions, there is `` `^`() `` and `I()`.]

When a function like $\sqrt[3]{x}$ is written as $x^{1/3}$ make sure to include the exponent in grouping parentheses: `x^(1/3)`. Similarly,
later in the course you will encounter power-law functions where the exponent is written as a formula. Particularly common will be power-law functions written $x^{n-1}$ or $x^{n+1}$. In translating this to computer notation, make sure to put the formula within grouping parentheses, for instance `x^(n-1)` or `x^(n+1)`.
