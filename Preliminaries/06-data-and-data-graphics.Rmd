## Data frames

frame, case, variable, row, column

accessing and basic operations
- built-in data frames, by name
- names(), head(), 
- URLs, might use files, but only occasionally

::: {.takenote}
We use the word ***variable*** to refer to a column of a data frame.
When refering to a quantity that is an input to a function, we use "input" or "argument" (they're equivalent)

## Discrete vs continuous

This is calculus, so we'll be working with continuous inputs. Tables have discrete inputs.

- Spliner, smoother, fitting, as examples of turning discrete into continuous.

## Bureaucratic analogy to a function

Tables are a useful way to think about how functions work, and allow us to disentangle ***formulas*** from ***functions***. 

## Point plots

Two quantitative variables




::: {.intheworld}
Other statistical graphics, e.g. densities
:::

## Graphics layers

Add a function on top of a data set

Dots on axis, horizontal and vertical lines (e.g. zeros)
