Here are some function definitions in the format we will use in this book. For each, say what is the **name of the function** being defined, what are the **names of the inputs** to the function, and what are the names, if any, of the **parameters** used in the definition.

1. $h(x) \equiv 3 x + 2$
2. $\text{line}(x) \equiv m x + b$
3. $\text{wave}(t) \equiv A \sin(2 \pi t/ P)$
4. $\text{plane}(x, y) \equiv a + bx + cy$
5. $f_1(z) = z^n$
