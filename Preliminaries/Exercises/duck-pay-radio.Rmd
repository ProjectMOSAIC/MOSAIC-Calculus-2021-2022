1. Demonstrate that between any two integers $a$ and $b$ there is a rational number. (Hint: Do some arithmetic with $a$ and $b$ to construct such a rational number.)

2. Demonstrate that between any two rational numbers $a/b$ and $c/d$  there is another rational number. (Hint: Construct such a rational number by arithmetic.)
