Each of these attempts to define a mathematical function using R leads to an error message. Modify the statement so that it works properly.

1. `f(x) <- makeFun(2*x + 3 ~ x)`
1. `h <- makeFun(x ~ 2*x + 3)`
1. `f <- makeFun(2x + 3)`
1. `g(x) <- makeFun(4 sin(x))`
1. `h2 <- 2*x + 3 ~ x`
1. `g2 <- makeFun(2*x + 3 ~ y)`
1. `p(x,y) <- makeFun(2 x + 3 y~ x & y)`
