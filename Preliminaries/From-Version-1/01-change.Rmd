## Quantity vs number



## Functions

The other central concept in the book is 
## Fundamental model of change

At the start of the chapter, it says, "Calculus is about change, and change is about relationships." The idea of a ***function*** gives a definite perspective on this. The relationship is between a function's input and the function's output. The input might be day of the year (1-365, often called the "Julian Date"), and the output cumulative rainfall up to that day. Every day it rains, the cumulative rainfall increases. For another function(, the input might be the altitude on your hike up [Pikes Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikes_Peak) and the output the air temperature. Typically, as you gain altitude the temperature goes down. With still another function, the input might be the number of hours after noon, the output the brightness of sunlight. As the sun goes down, the light grows dimmer, but only to a point.  `r mark(150)`

The ***rate of change*** is based on a simple question: If the input changes from $x = A$  to $x = B$, how much does the output change? Of course, the output from function $f(x)$ will be $f(x=A)$ and $f(x=B)$ respectively. The rate-of-change relationship is the ratio $$\frac{\color{red}{f(x=B) - f(x=A)}}{\color{blue}{B-A}}\ \ \text{also written}\ \ \frac{\color{red}{\text{rise}}}{\color{blue}{\text{run}}}$$

Why do we focus on the ***rate of change*** rather than something simpler, for example the ***net change*** $\color{red}{f(x=B) - f(x=A)}$? The reason goes back to a scientific breakthrough in the 1600s: the writing down of the Newton's laws of motion. The language in which these laws were first successfully expressed is the language of rates of change. In the intervening 400 years, the laws have been updated with the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. These laws too are expressed as rates of change. In undertaking to study just about any quantitative field from engineering to economics you'll find that theory is expressed using functions and rates of change.

You may recognize in the formula for the rate of change a familiar quantity: the slope of a line. Everyone understands what a line is, but the geometry is not our primary concern here. We describe relationships using functions and for us the straight-line function will be a fundamental way of expressing a relationship. Straight-line functions can be written in several ways, but we'll tend to use two predominant forms:
$$\line(x) \equiv a x + b\ \ \ \text{or}\ \ \ \ \line(x) \equiv a [x - x_0]$$
The two forms are interchangeable, but as you'll see in upcoming chapters, sometimes it's more convenient to use one form or the other. In either case, the rate of change is, quantitatively, the value of the parameter $a$.  `r mark(160)`

The simple function $\line(x)$, whose change relationship we understand intuitively, will be used to approximate more complicated change relationships. With the approximation in place, we can do calculations about the change relationships much more easily. Collectively, the set of mathematical concepts and techniques that support describing and calculating on change relationships has the name *Calculus*.

::: {.why  data-latex=""}
In writing $\line(x) \equiv a [x - x_0]$ I used ***square braces*** $\left[\strut\ \right]$ rather than parentheses $\left(\strut\ \right)$ to surround $x - x_0$. Either could be used and there is no difference in meaning. In traditional mathematical notation, either serves to demarcate a sub-expression. We'll be using parentheses very extensively in expressions like $\line(x)$, so it's nice to have a visual break.
