# Why preliminaries? {-}

Explain why we are starting with the preliminaries.

Your math background equipped you with particular mathematics knowledge and skills.

Yet there were probably gaps.

Also, the high-school curriculum focuses on certain parts of mathematics which date from the 18th century and before. It usually ignores the important developments in computing from the last century, except (bizarely) to incorporate graphing calculators, a tool not used in any scientific or engineering discipline. And the notation used in high-school mathematics is ambiguous and doesn't transfer well to computing.

This section gives an overview of the mathematical, computational, graphical, and data-handling skills you'll use in the rest of **MOSIAC Calculus**.
