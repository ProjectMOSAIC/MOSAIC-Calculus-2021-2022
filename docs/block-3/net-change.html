<p>Anti-derivatives are useful when you know how a quantity is changing but don’t yet know the quantity itself.</p>
<p>It’s important, of course, to keep track of which is the “quantity itself” and which is the “rate of increase in that quantity.” This always depends on context and your point of view. It’s convenient, then, to set some fixed examples to make it easy to keep track of which quantity is which.</p>

<p>We’ll also adopt a convention to make it simpler to recognize which quantity is the “quantity itself” and which is the “rate of increase in that quantity.” We will use CAPITAL LETTERS to name functions that are the quantity itself, and <em>lower-case</em> letters for the rate of increase in that quantity. For example, if talking about motion, an important quantity is <strong><em>momentum</em></strong> and how it changes over time. The momentum itself will be <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf M}(t)\)</span> while the rate of increase of momentum will be <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The amount of money a business has on hand at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf S}(t)\)</span> measured, say, in dollars. The rate of increase of that money is <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span>, in, say, dollars per day.</p>
<p>Notice that we’re using the phrase “rate of increase” rather than “rate of change.” That’s because we want to keep straight the meaning of the sign of the <em>lower-case</em> function. If <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> is positive, the momentum is increasing. If <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> is negative then it’s a “negative rate of increase,” which is, of course, just a “decrease.”</p>
<p>For a business, money coming in means that <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> is positive. Expenditures of money correspond to <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> being negative. In the fuel example. <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> is the amount of fuel in the tank. <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is the rate of <em>increase</em> in the amount of fuel in the tank. Of course, engines burn fuel, removing it from the tank. So we would write the rate at which fuel is burned as <span class="math inline">\(-f(t)\)</span>: removing fuel is a negative increase in the amount of fuel, an expenditure of fuel.</p>
<p>The objective of this chapter is to introduce you to the sorts of calculations, and their notations, that let you figure out how much the CAPITAL LETTER quantity has changed over an interval of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> based on what you already know about the value over time of the <em>lower-case</em> function.</p>
<p>The first step in any such calculation is to find or construct the <em>lower-case</em> function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> or whatever it might be. This is a modeling phase. In this chapter, we’ll ignore detailed modeling of the situation and just present you with the <em>lower-case</em> function.</p>
<p>The second step in any such calculation is to compute the anti-derivative of the <em>lower-case</em> function, giving as a result the CAPITAL LETTER function. You’ve already seen the notation for this, e.g.
<span class="math display">\[{\Large  F(t) = \int f(t) dt}\ \ \ \ \ \text{or}\ \ \ \ \ {\Large G(t) = \int g(t) dt}\ \ \ \ \text{and so on.}\]</span> In this chapter, we will not spend any time on this step; we will assume that you already have at hand the means to compute the anti-derivative. (Indeed, you already have <code>antiD()</code> available which will do the job for you.) Later chapters will look at the issues around and techniques for doing the computations by other means.</p>
<p>The remaining steps in such calculations are to work with the CAPITAL LETTER function to compute such things as the amount of that quantity, or the change in that quantity as it is accumulated over an interval of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>Sometimes you’re writing the capital letter functions in <strong>bold-face</strong>, e.g. <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> and other times you aren’t, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>. What’s going on?</p>
<p>This is a convention we’re adopting for this chapter, which is when we need it the most to introduce the concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Bold-face</strong> is being used in this chapter to represent the real-world quantity of interest. So <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> is the actual amount of fuel in the tank, <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf M}(t)\)</span> is the actual momentum of the car, and <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf S}(t)\)</span> is the actual amount of money on hand. The regular-face functions, <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> are the functions that we get by applying anti-differentiation to <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our broad interest is to construct the <strong>bold-face</strong> function knowing just the derivative of that function, which we’re writing in <em>lower-case</em>. So, <span class="math inline">\(f(t) \equiv \partial_t {\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(m(t) \equiv \partial_t {\mathbf M}(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s(t) \equiv \partial_t {\mathbf S}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we knew <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf M}(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf S}(t)\)</span>, that would be the end of the matter, since our interest is in the quantity <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf V}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf M}\)</span>. But we are working with a situation where we know <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>, or we know <span class="math inline">\(m(t)\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf M}(t)\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>How could such a situation arise in the real world? Suppose the car’s fuel gauge is broken, depriving us of direct knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf F\)</span>, but that we have a dashboard readout of the rate of fuel consumption. Then we would know <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>. Or suppose you are in charge of day-to-day running of a business, collecting the income each day and paying the daily expenses. Thus, each day you know <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span>—the cash flow. But it’s your boss who has access to the bank account; you merely deposit money as you get it and write checks or Venmo suppliers (or however it is that your business operates day to day). So your boss knows <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf S}(t)\)</span> but you know only <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since you know about anti-differentiation, you can try to reconstruct the fuel level <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> from the known <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, or to figure out the bank balance <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf S}(t)\)</span> from your records of <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>But anti-differentiation, while part of the solution, is only just a part. You can apply anti-differentiation to <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, but what you get back will be <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between the two? It involves a constant value <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> which, alas, you can never figure out from <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>. All that you can claim, given the <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> generated by anti-differentiation, is that <span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t) = F(t) + C .\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="net-change-1" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.1</span> Net change</h2>
<p>Perhaps it goes without saying, but once you have the CAPITAL LETTER function, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>, you can evaluate that function at any input that falls into the domain of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>. If you have a graph of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, just position your finger on the horizontal axis at input <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, then trace up to the function graph, then horizontally to the vertical axis where you can read off the value <span class="math inline">\(F(t_1)\)</span>. If you have <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> in the form of a computer function, just <strong><em>apply</em></strong> <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> to the input <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this regard, <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is like any other function.</p>
<p>However, in using and interpreting the <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> that we constructed by anti-differentiating <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, we have to keep in mind the limitations of the anti-differentiation process. In particular, any function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> does not have a unique anti-derivative function. If we have one anti-derivative, we can always construct another by adding some constant: <span class="math inline">\(F(t) + C\)</span> is also an anti-derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>But we have a special purpose in mind when calculating <span class="math inline">\(F(t_1)\)</span>. We want to figure out from <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> how much of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> has accumulated up to time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is the rate of increase in fuel (that is, the negative of fuel consumption), we want <span class="math inline">\(F(t_1)\)</span> to be the amount of fuel in our tank at time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>. <strong>That cannot happen.</strong> All we can say is that <span class="math inline">\(F(t_1)\)</span> is the amount of fuel in the tank at <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> give or take some unknown constant C.</p>
<p>Instead, the correct use of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is to say how much the quantity has changed over some interval of time, <span class="math inline">\(t_0 \leq t \leq t_1\)</span>. This “change in the quantity” is called the <strong><em>net change</em></strong> in <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span>. To calculate the net change in <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> we apply <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> to both <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, then subtract:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Net change in}\ F(t) \ \text{from}\ t_0 \ \text{to}\ t_1 :\\= F(t_1) - F(t_0)\]</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-2" class="example"><strong>Example 29.1  </strong></span>Suppose you have already constructed the rate-of-change function for momentum <span class="math inline">\(m()\)</span> and implemented it as an R function <code>m()</code>.

<p>To make use of this quantity, you’ll need to know it’s dimension and units.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.2</span> The “definite” integral</h2>
<p>We have described the process of calculating a net change from the <em>lower-case</em> function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> in terms of two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Construct <span class="math inline">\(F(t) = \int f(t) dt\)</span>.</li>
<li>Evaluate <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> at two inputs, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(F(t_2) - F(t_1)\)</span>, giving a net change, which we’ll write as <span class="math inline">\({\cal F}(t_1, t_2) = F(t_2) - F(t_1)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a matter of notation, the process of going from <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> to the net change is written as one statement.
<span class="math display">\[{\cal F}(t_1, t_2) = F(t_2) - F(t_1) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t) dt\]</span></p>
<p>The punctuation <span class="math display">\[\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \_\_\_\_ dt\]</span> captures in one construction both the anti-differentiation step (<span class="math inline">\(\int\_\_dt\)</span>) and the evaluation of the anti-derivative at the two bound <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Several names are used to describe the overall process. It is important to become familiar with these.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(t) dt\)</span> is called a <strong><em>definite integral</em></strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are called, respectively, the <strong><em>lower bound of integration</em></strong> and the <strong><em>upper bound of integration</em></strong>, although given the way we draw graphs it might be better to call them the “left” and “right” bounds, rather than lower and upper.</li>
<li>The pair <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> is called the <strong><em>bounds of integration</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, it pays to know what <em>kind of thing</em> is <span class="math inline">\({\cal F}(t_1, t_2)\)</span>.
Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> are fixed quantities, say <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 2\)</span> seconds and <span class="math inline">\(t_2 = 5\)</span> seconds, then <span class="math inline">\({\cal F}(t_1, t_2)\)</span> is itself a quantity. The dimension of that quantity is [<span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>] which in turn is [<span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>]<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>[<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>]. So if <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is fuel consumption in liters per second, then <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> will have units of liters, and <span class="math inline">\({\cal F}(t_1, t_2)\)</span> will also have units of liters.</p>
<p>Remember also an important distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(t) = \int f(t) dt\)</span> is a <strong><em>function</em></strong> whose output is a quantity.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(t_2) - F(t_1) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t) dt\)</span> is a <strong><em>quantity</em></strong>, not a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is a <strong><em>function</em></strong> whose output is a quantity. In general, the two functions <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> produce outputs that are <em>different kinds</em> of quantities. For instance, the output of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is liters of fuel while the output of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is liters per second: fuel consumption. Similarly, the output of <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is dollars, while the output of <span class="math inline">\(s(t)\)</span> is dollars per day.</p>
<p>The use of the term <strong><em>definite integral</em></strong> suggests that there might be something called an <strong><em>indefinite integral</em></strong>, and indeed there is. “Indefinite integral” is just a synonym for “anti-derivative.” In this book we favor the use of <strong><em>anti-derivative</em></strong> because it’s too easy to leave off the “indefinite” and confuse an indefinite integral with a definite integral. Also, “anti-derivative” makes it completely clear what is the relationship to “derivative.”</p>
<p>Since 1700, it’s common for calculus courses to be organized into two divisions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Differential calculus, which is the study of derivatives and their uses.</li>
<li>Integral calculus, which is the study of anti-derivatives and their uses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematical notation having been developed for experts rather than for students, very small typographical changes are often used to signal very large changes in meaning. When it comes to anti-differentiation, there are two poles of fixed meaning and then small changes which modify the meaning. The poles are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Anti-derivative: <span class="math inline">\(\int f(t) dt\)</span>, which is a function whose output is a quantity.</li>
<li>Definite integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(t) dt\)</span>, which is a quantity, plain and simple.</li>
</ol>
<p>But you will also see some intermediate forms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(t) dt\)</span>, which is a <strong>function</strong> with input <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\int_a^x f(t) dt\)</span>, which is the same function as in (a) but with the input name <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> being used.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\int_t^b f(t) dt\)</span>, which is a <strong>function</strong> with input <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Less commonly, <span class="math inline">\(\int_x^t f(t) dt\)</span> which is a <strong>function</strong> with two inputs, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The same is true of <span class="math inline">\(\int_x^y f(t) dt\)</span> and similar variations.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="initial-value-of-the-quantity" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.3</span> Initial value of the quantity</h2>
<p>Recall that we’re interested in a real quantity <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>, but we only know <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> and from that can calculate an anti-derivative <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>. The relationship between them is
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t) = F(t) + C\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is some fixed quantity that we cannot determine directly from <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Still, even if we cannot determine <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, there’s one way we can use <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> to make definite statements about <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>. Consider the net change from <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> in the real quantity <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}\)</span>. This is
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t_2) - {\mathbf F}(t_1) =  \left[F(t_2) + C\right] - \left[F(t_1) + C\right] = F(t_2) - F(t_1)\]</span>
In other words, just knowing <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>, we can make completely accurate statements about net changes in the value of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s develop our understanding of this unknown constant <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which is called the <strong><em>constant of integration</em></strong>. To do so, watch the following movie which attempts to show the process of constructing the integral <span class="math display">\[F(t) = \int_2^t f(t) dt\ .\]</span></p>

</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Focus first on the top graph. The function we are integrating, <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, is known before we carry out the integration, so it is shown in the top graph.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is the rate of increase in <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> for that matter). From the graph, you can read using the vertical axis the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> for any input <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. But since <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is a rate of increase, we can also depict <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> as a slope. That slope is being drawn as a <span class="math inline">\(\color{magenta}{\text{magenta}}\)</span> arrow. Notice that when <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is positive, the arrow slopes upward and when <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is negative, the arrow slopes downward. The steepness of the arrow is the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, so for inputs where the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is far from zero the arrow is steeper than for values of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> that are near zero.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Now look at both graphs, but concentrate just on the arrows in the two graphs. They are always the same: carbon copies of one another.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally the bottom graph. We’re starting the integral at <span class="math inline">\(t_1=2\)</span>. Since nothing has yet been accumulated, the value <span class="math inline">\(F(t_1 = 2) = 0\)</span>. From (1) and (2), you know the arrow shows the slope of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>. So as <span class="math inline">\(F(t&gt;2)\)</span> is being constructed the arrow guides the way. When the slope arrow is positive, <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is growing. When the slope arrow is negative, <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is going down.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In tallying up the accumulation of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, we started at time <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span> and with <span class="math inline">\(F(t=2) = 0\)</span>. This makes sense, since nothing can be accumulated over the mere instant of time from <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span>. On the other hand, it was our choice to start at <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span>. We might have started at another value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> such as <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t=-5\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t=-\infty\)</span>. If so, then the accumulation of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> up to <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span> would likely have been something other than zero.</p>
<p>But what if we knew an actual value for <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(2)\)</span>. This is often the case. For instance, before taking a trip you might have filled up the fuel tank. The accumulation of fuel consumption only tells you how much fuel has been used since the start of the trip. But if you know the starting amount of fuel, by adding that to the accumulation you’ll know instant by instant how much fuel is in the tank. In other words, <span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t) = {\mathbf F}(2) + \int_2^t f(t) dt\ .\]</span>
This is why, when we write an anti-derivative, we should always include mention of some constant <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>—the so-called <strong><em>constant of integration</em></strong>—to remind us that there is a difference between the <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> we get from anti-differentiation and the <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> of the function we’re trying to reconstruct. That is,
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t) = F(t) + C = \int f(t) dt + C\ .\]</span>
We only need to know <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> at one point in time, say <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, to be able to figure out the value of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[C = {\mathbf F}(0) - F(0)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>Another way to state the relationship between the anti-derivative and <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf F}(t)\)</span> is by using the anti-derivative to accumulate <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> from some starting point <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. That is:
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(t) \ =\  {\mathbf F}(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^t f(t)\, dt\  = \ 
{\mathbf F}(t_0) + \left({\large\strut}F(t) - F(t_0)\right)\]</span></p>
<div class="intheworld">
<p>A famous legend has Galileo at the top of the Tower of Pisa around 1590. The legend illustrates Galileo’s finding that a light object (e.g. a marble) and a heavy object (e.g. a ball) will fall at the same speed. Galileo published his mathematical findings in 1638 in <em>Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze</em>. (English: Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences)</p>
<p>In 1687, Newton published his world-changing<em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>. (English: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)</p>
<p>Let’s imagine the ghost of Galileo returned to Pisa in 1690 after reading Newton’s <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. In this new legend, Galileo holds a ball still in his hand, releases it, and figures out the position of the ball as a function of time.</p>
<p>Although Newton famously demonstrated that gravitational attraction is a function of the distance between to objects, he also knew that at a fixed distance—the surface of the Earth—gravitational acceleration was constant. So Galileo was vindicated by Newton. But, although gravitational acceleration is constant from top to bottom of the Tower of Pisa, Galileo’s ball was part of a more complex system: a hand holding the ball still until release. Acceleration of the ball versus time is therefore approximately a Heaviside function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{accel}(t) \equiv \left\{\begin{array}{rl}0 &amp; \text{for}\ t \leq 3\\
{-9.8}  &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]</span></p>

<p>Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. We can construct a function <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> as the anti-derivative of acceleration, but the real-world velocity function will be
<span class="math display">\[{\mathbf V}(t) = {\mathbf V}(0) + \int_0^t \text{accel}(t) dt\]</span></p>

<p>In the computer expression, the parameter <code>V0</code> stands for <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf V}(0)\)</span>. We’ve set it equal to zero since, at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, Galileo was holding the ball still.</p>
<p>Velocity is the derivative of position, but the real-world velocity function will be the accumulation of velocity from some starting time to time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, plus the position at that starting time:
<span class="math display">\[x(t) \equiv x(0) + \int_0^t V(t) dt\]</span>
We can calculate <span class="math inline">\(\int V(t) dt\)</span> easily enough with <code>antiD()</code>, but the function <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> involves evaluating that anti-derivative at times 0 and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:</p>

<p>In the (fictional) account of the 1690 experiment, we had Galileo release the ball at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. That’s a common device in mathematical derivations, but in a physical sense it’s entirely arbitrary. Galileo might have let go of the ball at any other time, say, <span class="math inline">\(t=3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t=14:32:05\)</span>.</p>
<p>A remarkable feature of integrals is that it doesn’t matter what we use as the lower bound of integration, so long as we set the initial value to correspond to that bound.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>For a while you were writing integrals like this: <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(t) dt\)</span>. Then you replaced <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> with the input name <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(t) dt\)</span>. But then you switched everything up by writing <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(x) dx\)</span>. Is that the same as <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(t) dt\)</span>? If so, why do you get to replace the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in some places but not in others?</p>
<p>Recall from Chapter 5 that the names used for inputs to a function definition don’t matter so long as they are used consistently on the left and right sides of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>. For instance, all these are the same function:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(x) \equiv m x + b\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g(t) \equiv m t + b\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h(\text{wind}) \equiv m \text{wind} + b\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about the integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(t) dt\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>On the left-hand side, the input name <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is prominant, appearing in two places: <span class="math inline">\(f(\color{magenta}{t}) d\color{magenta}{t}\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is nowhere on the right-hand side. We could have equally well written this as <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(x) dx\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^b f(\text{wind}) d\text{wind}\)</span>. The name we use for the input to <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> doesn’t matter so long as it is consistent with the name used in the <span class="math inline">\(d\_\_\)</span> part of the notation. Often, the name placed in the blanks in <span class="math inline">\(\int f(\_\_) d\_\_\)</span> is called a <strong><em>dummy variable</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Writing <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(t) dt\)</span> is perfectly reasonable, but many authors dislike the multiple appearance of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. So they write something like <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(x) dx\)</span> instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>The relationship between an integral and its corresponding anti-derivative function: <span class="math display">\[\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\]</span> This relationship has a fancy-sounding name: the <strong><em>second fundamental theorem of calculus</em></strong>.</li>
<li>The accumulation from an initial-value <span class="math display">\[{\mathbf F}(b)\  =\  {\mathbf F}(a) + \int_a^b f(x) dx\  = \ {\mathbf F}(a) + F(b) - F(a)\]</span>
For many modeling situations, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are fixed quantities, so <span class="math inline">\(F(a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F(b)\)</span> are also quantities; the output of the anti-derivative function at inputs <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. But either the lower-bound or the upper-bound can be input names, as in <span class="math display">\[\int_0^t f(x) dx = F(t) - F(0)\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is not a quantity but a function of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>On occasion, you will see forms like <span class="math inline">\(\int_t^0 f(x)dx\)</span>. You can think of this in either of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The accumulation from a time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> less than 0 up until 0.</li>
<li>The <em>reverse</em> accumulation from 0 until time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reverse accumulation can be a tricky concept because it violates everyday intuition. Suppose you were harvesting a row of ripe strawberries. You start at the beginning of the row—position zero. Then you move down the row, picking strawberries and placing them in your basket. When you have reached position <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> your basket holds the accumulation <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^B s(x)\, dx\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s(x)\)</span> is the lineal density of strawberries—units: berries per meter of row.</p>
<p>But suppose you go the other way, starting with an empty basket at position <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and working your way back to position 0. Common sense says your basket will fill to exactly the same amount as in the forward direction, and indeed this is the case. But integrals work differently. The integral <span class="math inline">\(\int_B^0 s(x) dx\)</span> will be the <strong>negative</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^B s(x) dx\)</span>. You can see this from the relationship between the integral and the anti-derivative:
<span class="math display">\[\int_B^0 s(x) dx \ = \ S(0) - S(B) \ =\ -\left[{\large\strut}S(B) - S(0)\right]\ = \ -\int_0^B s(x) dx\]</span></p>
<p>This is not to say that there is such a thing as a negative strawberry. Rather, it means that harvesting strawberries is similar to an integral in some ways (accumulation) but not in other ways. In farming, harvesting from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is much the same as harvesting from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to 0, but integrals don’t work this way.</p>
<p>Another property of integrals is that the interval between bounds of integration can be broken into pieces. For instance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^c f(x) dx \ = \ \int_a^b f(x) dx + \int_b^c f(x) dx\]</span>
You can confirm this by noting that
<span class="math display">\[\int_a^b f(x) dx + \int_b^c f(x) dx \ = \ \left[{\large\strut}F(b) - F(a)\right] + \left[{\large\strut}F(c) - F(b)\right] = F(c) - F(a) \ = \ \int_a^c f(x) dx\ .\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, consider this function of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t \int_a^t f(x) dx\ .\]</span>
First, how do we know it is a function of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>? <span class="math inline">\(\int_a^t f(x) dx\)</span> is a definite integral and has the value <span class="math display">\[\int_a^t f(x) dx = F(t) - F(a)\  .\]</span> Following our convention, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a parameter and stands for a specific numerical value, so <span class="math inline">\(F(a)\)</span> is the output of <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> for a specific input. But according to convention <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the name of an input. So <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is a function whose output depends on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Differentiating the function <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>, as with every other function, produces a new function.</p>
<p>Second, there is a shortcut for calculating <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t \int_a^t f(x) dx\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t \int_a^t f(x) dx\ =\ \partial_t \left[{\large\strut}F(t) - F(a)\right]\ .\]</span>
Since <span class="math inline">\(F(a)\)</span> is a quantity and not a function, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t F(a) = 0\)</span>. That simplies things. Even better, we know that the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is simply <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>: that’s just the nature of the derivative/anti-derivative relationship between <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span>. Put together, we have:
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t \int_a^t f(x) dx\ =\ f(t)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>This complicated-looking identity has a fancy name: the <strong><em>first fundamental theorem of calculus</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Backtracking the stars.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, astronomers and cosmologists questioned the idea that the large-scale universe is static and unchanging. This traditional belief was undermined both by theory (e.g. General Relativity) and observations. The most famous of these were collected and published by Edwin Hubble, starting in 1929 and continuing over the next decade as improved techniques and larger telescopes became available. In recent years, with the availability of the space telescope named in honor of Hubble data has expanded in availability and quality. Figure <a href="net-change.html#fig:hubble-curve">29.3</a> shows a version of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/15/3/168">Hubble’s 1929 graph</a> based on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC314128/">contemporary data</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 29.3: The relationship between velocity and distance of stars, using contemporary data in the same format at Edwin Hubble’s 1929 publication.
</p>
</div>
<p>Each dot in Figure <a href="net-change.html#fig:hubble-curve">29.3</a> is an exploding star called a <em>supernova</em>. The graph shows the relationship between the distance of the star from our galaxy and the outward velocity of that star. The velocities are large, <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 10^4 = 30,000\)</span> km/s is about one-tenth the speed of light. Similarly, the distances are big; 600 Mpc is the same as 2 billion light years or <span class="math inline">\(1.8 \times 10^{22} \text{km}\)</span>. The slope of the line in Figure <a href="net-change.html#fig:hubble-curve">29.3</a> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3.75 \times 10^4\, \text{km/s}}{1.8 \times 10^{22}\, \text{km}} = 2.1 \times 10^{-18}\, \text{s}^{-1}\)</span>. For ease of reading, we’ll call this slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and therefore the velocity of a start distance <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> from Earth is <span class="math display">\[v(D) \equiv \alpha D\ .\]</span></p>
<p>Earlier in the history of the universe each star was a different distance from Earth. We’ll call this function <span class="math inline">\(D(t)\)</span>, distance as a function of time in the universe.</p>
<p>The distance travelled by each star from time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (billions of years ago) to the present is
<span class="math display">\[\int_t^\text{now} v(t) dt  = D_\text{now} - D(t)\]</span>
which can be re-arranged to give
<span class="math display">\[D(t) = D_\text{now} - \int_t^\text{now} v(t) dt .\]</span>
Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(v(t)\)</span> for each star has remained constant at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha D_\text{now}\)</span>, the distance travelled by each star since time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> depends on it’s current distance like this:
<span class="math display">\[\int_t^\text{now} v(t) dt = \int_t^\text{now} \left[ \alpha D_\text{now}\right]\, dt = \alpha D_\text{now}\left[\text{now} - t\right]\]</span>
Thus, the position of each star at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[D(t) = D_\text{now} - \alpha D_\text{now}\left[\text{now} - t\right] = D(t)\]</span> or,
<span class="math display">\[D(t) = D_\text{now}\left({\large\strut} 1-\alpha \left[\text{now} - t\right]\right)\]</span></p>
<p>According to this model, there was a common time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> when when all the stars were at the same place: <span class="math inline">\(D(t_0) = 0\)</span>. This happened when <span class="math display">\[\text{now} - t_0 = \frac{1}{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2.1 \times 10^{-18}\, \text{s}^{-1}} = 4.8 \times 10^{17} \text{s}\ .\]</span>
It seems fair to call such a time, when all the stars where at the same place at the same time, as the origin of the universe. If so, <span class="math inline">\(\text{now} - t_0\)</span> corresponds to the <strong><em>age of the universe</em></strong> and our estimate of that age is <span class="math inline">\(4.8\times 10^{17}\text{s}\)</span>. Conventionally, this age is reported in years. To get that, we multiply by the <strong><em>flavor of one</em></strong> that turns seconds into years:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{60\, \text{seconds}}{1\, \text{minute}} \cdot \frac{60\, \text{minutes}}{1\, \text{hour}} \cdot \frac{24\, \text{hours}}{1\, \text{day}} \cdot \frac{365\, \text{days}}{1\, \text{year}} = 31,500,000 \frac{\text{s}}{\text{year}}\]</span>
The grand (but hypothetical) meeting of the stars therefore occurred <span class="math inline">\(4.8 \times 10^{17} \text{s} / 3.15 \times 10^{7} \text{s/year} = 15,000,000,000\)</span> years ago. Pretty crowded to have all the mass in the universe in one place at the same time. No wonder they call it the Big Bang!</p>

<p>The equation below shows three items, all of which are equivalent even though they look different. You can see this from the equal signs separating the three items.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\large \int_{\color{brown}{a}}^{\color{brown}{b}} {\color{blue}{f(x)}}\, dx = {\color{magenta}{F(x)}}\left.{\LARGE\strut}\right|_{\color{brown}{a}}^{\color{brown}{b}} = {\color{magenta}{F}({\color{brown}{b}})} -{\color{magenta}{F}({\color{brown}{a}})}\]</span></p>
<p>When you reach the point where you can say, “That’s obvious,” and can write down the three items from memory, you will have achieved an important facility with calculus.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> Since the three items are equivalent, they are all the same kind of “thing.” What kind of thing are they?</p>

<p>Remember our conventions for notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed quantities (perhaps with units)
<ul>
<li>Symbols: e.g. <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t^{\star}\)</span></li>
<li>Examples: 3.2, 4.8 meters, 17 feet/sec<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Names of inputs to functions
<ul>
<li>Symbols: e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span></li>
<li>Examples: position, time, velocity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Functions of an input
<ul>
<li>Symbols: e.g. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h(x, t)\)</span></li>
<li>Examples: position as a function of time, density as a function of position</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Functions evaluated at a specific numerical input
<ul>
<li>Symbols: e.g. <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(t_0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h(x^{\star}, t^{\star})\)</span></li>
<li>Examples: velocity at the finish line, starting position</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, take care to distinguish between these two kinds of symbolic items:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> as a <strong>function</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></li>

</ol>
<p>A major source of confusion for students is that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a constant, even though we are not yet saying specifically which numerical value that constant has. Think of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as meaning “insert constant here.” In terms of derivatives …</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(a) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span> is a function</li>

<p>Now turn to the entities involved in the so-called “First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.” (“Fundamental theorem” is a highfalutin way of saying something like, “This isn’t obvious at first glance, and so you should be especially careful to memorize it so that you identify it when you see it.” Another way to state it is, “Every function is the derivative of some anti-derivative.” But you knew that already, since “every function has an anti-derivative.”)</p>
<p>Here are the entities involved, which you’ll recognize as a slight modification of an earlier statement:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\partial_u \int_a^u f(x)dx \ \ =\ \ \partial_u \left. F(x) \right|_a^u \ \ = \ \ \partial_u \left(F(u) - F(a)\right) .\]</span>
Let’s look at the right-most expression <span class="math inline">\(\partial_u \left(F(u) + F(a)\right)\)</span> and exploit the the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. So …
<span class="math display">\[\partial_u \left(F(u) + F(a)\right) = \partial_u F(u) - \partial_u F(a) = \partial_u F(u)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Question G</strong> Which of the following correctly justifies the step <span class="math display">\[\partial_u F(u) - \partial_u F(a) = \partial_u F(u)\ \text{?}\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<p>Taking the left-most and right-most expressions in the above equation, we have
<span class="math display">\[\partial_u \int_a^u f(x) dx = \partial_u F(u)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Question H</strong> Is there an algebraic simplification of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_u F(u)\)</span>?</p>

</ol>
The equation <span class="math display">\[\partial_u \int_a^u f(x) dx \ \ = \ \  f(u)\]</span> means that “differentiation undoes integration” or, as we’ve been putting it, “differentiation undoes anti-differentiation.”

<p>In the 1660s, John Boyle made use of then-new instrumentation to measure gas pressure. He discovered what’s now called <em>Boyle’s Law</em>, which says that, at constant temperature in a closed system, pressure times volume is a constant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PV = const\]</span>
In the 1720s, Daniel Fahrenheit developed the first reliable thermometer consisting of a column of mercury in a glass straw. He developed a temperature scale which divided the range from freezing to boiling into 180 small units, which he called “degrees,” as was traditional in measuring angles. (In 1742, Anders Celsius created another scale with freezing at 0 and 100 small units—still called “degrees”—between freezing and boiling.</p>
<p>With the availability of reliable thermometers, scientists started to consider the role of temperature in the relationship between pressure and volume. Their many discoveries were eventually synthesized into a “combined gas law” and then into an “ideal gas law” which famously states:
<span class="math display">\[PV = nRT .\]</span>
Here, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is “amount” of gas, quantified as the number of moles of the gas in the container, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is temperature, and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the “ideal gas constant”:
<span class="math display">\[R = 8.314  \text{J}/(\text{K}\ \text{mol})\]</span>
The “mol” cancels out the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> cancels out the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, leaving us with <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> having the dimension of energy (Joules). The temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is measured in degrees Kelvin, which is just like Celsius but moving the location of 0 from freezing to … well … the hypothetical temperature when <span class="math inline">\(PV=0\)</span>, which can be estimated by extrapolating measurements of <span class="math inline">\(PV(T)\)</span> (that is, <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) to the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(PV = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> It’s convenient to have specific units in mind for pressure and volume. Since <span class="math inline">\(P V\)</span> gives energy, let’s arrange <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> to have units such that when multiplied the result is Joules. What is the expression of the dimension Joule in terms of the SI system, that is, time in seconds, length in meters, and mass in kg? Hint: use the above paragraph and knowing that the units for energy are consistent for potential, kinetic, or other types of energy.</p>

<p>For use in calculus, it’s helpful to re-write the Ideal Gas Law in functional form. There are several ways to do this. For instance, if we wanted to measure the number of moles of gas in a container, we could use the function <span class="math inline">\(n(P, V, T) = PV/RT\)</span>. Here, we’re going to focus on pressure as a function of the other quantities:
<span class="math display">\[P(n, V, T) = nRT/V.\]</span>
Now consider a very simple machine consisting of a cylinder, closed on one end and sealed by a movable piston at the other, as in this picture.</p>
<p><img src="Exercises/www/Piston.gif" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=375503">R. Castelnuovo - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0</a></p>
<p>The machine in the picture is more complicated than the simple machine we want to model. The picture includes two small valves at the top of the cylinder connected each to a pipe.</p>
<p>Our machine has no valves and no pipes. The cylinder is charged with gas when it is manufactured. After that, nothing material goes in or out of the closed cylinder/piston system.</p>
<p>When you push on the cylinder, the volume available for the gas gets smaller and the pressure increases. When you let the cylinder push on you, the volume available gets bigger and the pressure decreases. The amount of gas, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, never changes. For simplicity, we’ll imagine that <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> and that the gas is N<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. This means the mass of the gas is 0.028 kg.</p>
<p>And, to simplify even more, let’s insist that the temperature of the cylinder and its gaseous content does not change from room temperature: 293<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> Kelvin.</p>
<p><img src="MOSAIC-Calculus_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If you start in a high-volume, low-pressure state and push the piston to move to a low-volume, high-pressure state at the same temperature, you will be putting energy into the machine.</p>
<p>The “area” of each little box in the graph, that is, pressure times volume,
<strong>Question C</strong> How much energy (in Joules) corresponds to one small rectangle of area in the graph?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

</ol>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> By counting rectangles in the graph, estimate how much energy needs to be put into the machine when the volume changes from 7.5 m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> to 2.5 m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> at a temperature of 300 K?</p>

<p>Now that you have compressed the gas in the cylinder, by doing work on it, let’s heat up the machine to 1200K.</p>
<p><strong>Question E</strong> What will be the pressure of the gas when the volume of the machine is 2.5 m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> at temperature 1200 K? (The units will be kg m$^{-1} <span class="math inline">\(s^{-2}\)</span>)</p>

<p><strong>Question F</strong> Starting with the machine at 1200K and a volume of 2.5 m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>, how much energy will the machine transfer to you when it expands to 7.5 m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>? Estimate this by counting squares in the graph.</p>
<p>    <span class="Zchoice">about 5000 J<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">about 10,000 J<span class="mcanswer"><span class="math inline">\(\heartsuit\ \)</span></span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">about 50,000 J<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">about 100,000 J<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></p>
<p>The net work done by the machine in completing the cycle, shifting from compression at low temperature to expansion at high temperature, is the difference between the energy put out by the machine when expanding and the energy put into the machine to compress the gas. Such a machine is called a “heat engine” since it turns a source of high temperature and a source of low temperature into energy.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/CalcZ-Sandbox/">SANDBOX</a>, evaluate the code below. The first line defines a function <span class="math inline">\(P(V, T)\)</span> with default <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> mole of gas. Anti-differentiate <span class="math inline">\(P()\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> then calculate the energy needed to compress the cylinder at the low temperature, that is <span class="math display">\[\int_{7.5}^{2.5} P(V, T=300) dV .\]</span> Call this numerical result <code>compress_energy</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, calculate the energy done by the machine in the high-temperature expansion <span class="math display">\[\int_{2.5}^{7.5} P(V, T=1200) dV .\]</span> Call this numerical result <code>expand_energy</code>.</p>
<p>You may want to make a graph of your <span class="math inline">\(P(V, T)\)</span> function to check that it is right. Also, check that the integrals are right by comparing them to the rough estimate you made earlier by counting squares.</p>

<p>The function <code>windspeed(t)</code> records wind speed at the site of a wind-turbine farm over one day, that is, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq t \leq 24\)</span> hours. The function <code>speed2power(s)</code> is the production function for the model of wind turbine used at the farm: the input is speed in miles per hour, the output is in kilowatts. (Both these functions were created for this exercise. They are not about a real turbine at a real wind farm, but are somewhat realistic.) Hint: you can nest a function inside of another function. For instance, if I had a function (‘solarpanelpower’) that calculates the amount of power a solar panel generates and another function (‘sunlight’) that tells me the amount of sunlight at time of the day (‘TOD’). I could evaluate this in one step like the following: ‘solarpanelpower(sunlight(TOD))’. This would give me the amount of power from the solar panel based upon the time of the day.</p>
<p>Your task, find the <em>total energy</em> generated over the 24-hour period by the turbine. Reminder: energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is electric power multiplied by time. Or, more usefully for this problem, the increment energy <span class="math inline">\(dE\)</span> generated at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the product of power at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> multiplied by the increment of time <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(dE = p(t) dt\)</span>. Consequently, <span class="math display">\[E = \int_\text{morning}^\text{night} p(t) dt\]</span> where “morning” should really be 00:00 h and night 24:00 h on the day in question.</p>
<p>We don’t have an algebraic formula for <code>windspeed(t)</code> even though it is a function. You can use <code>antiD()</code> to find the anti-derivative of the electric power function.</p>

<p>Your house has solar panels on the roof. In sunshine, these generate power. You use some of that power immediately for cooking, lighting, and such. Any power generated above your needs gets stored in a battery. Any power used above the solar generation gets supplied by the battery.</p>
<p>Over the course of a day, your use of power fluctuates (you use the toaster, open the refrigerator, etc). Similarly, the solar generation fluctuates as clouds pass by and the sun rises and sets in the sky. The amount of energy stored in the battery fluctuates over the day as you consume energy in your home and produce it with the solar panels.</p>
<p>The unit used for electrical power is a “kilowatt” (kW). An old-fashioned incandescent light bulb consumes about 0.1 kW while lighted, a modern LED bulb generates about the same amount of light using only 0.01 kW. A refrigerator uses about 0.1 kW while a hair-dryer uses about 1 kW when it is running.</p>
<p>Batteries store energy. The usual unit for energy is “kilowatt-hour” (kWh). A refrigerator will, over a 24-hour day, use 0.1 * 24 = 2.4 kWh. Power multiplied by time duration gives energy. If the power were constant, the energy could be calculated by a simple multiplication of the power over the duration. Since power fluctuates, we can’t do the calculation with ordinary multiplication. Instead, we have to integrate power over time.</p>
<p>For this activity, use the “Solar-panels” App.</p>
<div class="todo">
<p>Add picture/link to app.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> Why is it called “net production” instead of just “production?”</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">Because your house is connected to the utility electrical network in case you need extra power.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">Because the system designer is something of a poet and wants you to think of the solar cells as a kind of fishing net harvesting photons.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">Because the government will send you surplus hair nets to thank you for reducing CO2 production.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">Because it’s not simply production from the solar panels but production <em>minus</em> consumption (the solar panels require energy to run). If you ignored consumption, you would call it “gross energy produced.”<span class="mcanswer">Right! </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> The bottom graph shows energy accumulated in the battery since midnight. What does it mean that the energy accumulated is negative?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">The battery level is lower throughout the day than it was at midnight.<span class="mcanswer">Excellent! </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">The battery is discharging over the entire day.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ It’s the top graph, net power production, that tells if if the battery is charging (positive net production) or discharging (negative net production). So this statement is not always accurate</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">The sign is not important.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ The sign is important</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> During the interval from 05:00 to 20:00, how much did the energy stored by the battery change? Highlight that interval in the beeps graph.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">-2.5 kWh<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ Is there more or less energy in the battery between these two points?</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">1.9 kW<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ Energy has units kWh, not kW.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">15 hours<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ This is the length of the interval, not the energy stored.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">1.5 kWh<span class="mcanswer">Correct. You an calculate this by taking the difference between the relative battery level at the end of the interval and at the start of the interval. These values are shown as blue dots on the bottom graph (if you used the cursor to highlight the interval).</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> Suppose the battery was holding 20 kWh at 00:00. How much energy was it holding at 15:00?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">-2 kWh<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ This is the change in the battery energy level, what is the actual value at the level?</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">18 kWh<span class="mcanswer">Correct. </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">20 kWh<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">24 kWh<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question E</strong> When you choose a time interval in the beep graph, how come the energy stored (in kWh) is displayed as an area in the top graph? Keep in mind that the vertical scale of the top graph is kW, not kWh.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">It’s pretty.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ Thanks. But there’s a better reason that’s relevant to calculus.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">To highlight visually the interval that that was selected.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ There would be other ways to show the interval.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">To convert kW to kWh, we are effectively multiplying the power (kW) by the time duration. Power is on the vertical axis, time duration is on the horizontal axis. Multiplying the two corresponds to the area under the graph.<span class="mcanswer">Correct. In this instance, energy is acting as the anti-derivative of the power function with respect to time</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question F</strong> How come two different colors are used to display the “area” under the net power curve?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">The second derivative of the anti-derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ The statement is true, but it’s irrelevant to the question being asked.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">No reason related to calculus <em>per se</em>. We like to make graphs pretty.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">Because it’s not simply “area.” It’s the product of net power and time duration, and sometimes this quantity is negative. The color indicates whether the quantity is positive or negative at any instant.<span class="mcanswer">Good. </span></span></li>
