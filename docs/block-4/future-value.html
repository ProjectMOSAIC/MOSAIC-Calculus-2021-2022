<p>Comparison is an important element of human decision making. Often, comparison amounts to translating each of the options at hand into a scalar or score. Scalars are easy to compare; the skill is taught in elementary school. Scalar comparison is completely objective. Putting aside the possibility of error, everyone will agree on which of two numbers is bigger. Importantly, comparison of scalars is <strong><em>transitive</em></strong>, that is if <span class="math inline">\(a &gt; b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; c\)</span> then it is impossible that <span class="math inline">\(a \leq c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The comparison of scalars can be extended to situations where the options available form a continuum and the score for each option is represented by a function, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. As we saw in Chapters 23 and <a href="optimization-and-constraint.html#optimization-and-constraint">34</a> selecting the highest scoring option is a matter of finding the argmax.</p>
<p>Many decisions involve options that have two or more attributes that are not directly comparable. Expenditure decisions have this flavor: Is it worth the money to buy a more reliable or prettier or more capable version of a product? The techniques of <strong><em>constrained optimization</em></strong> (Chapter <a href="optimization-and-constraint.html#optimization-and-constraint">34</a>) provide one useful approach for informing decisions when there are multiple objectives.</p>
<p>Elections are a form of collective decision making. The options—called, of course, “candidates”—have many attributions. Three commonly mentioned are attitudes toward social policy, toward fiscal policy, and toward foreign policy. Perceived honesty and trustworthiness as well as the ability to influence other decision makers and perceived ability to win the election are other attributes that are considered and balanced. Ultimately the decision is made by condensing the diverse attributes into a single number: how many votes the candidate garnered. With this number attached to each of the candidates, it’s easy to make the decision, which could be written
<span class="math display">\[\mathop{\text{argmax}}_{i} \text{votes}(\text{candidate}_i)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>This chapter is about often encountered settings where attributes are presented as a function on a domain and it is desired to reduce the function to a single, representative number. To avoid unnecessary abstraction, we’ll consider two different types of domain: time and age.</p>
<div id="present-value-time" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">36.1</span> Present value (time)</h2>
<p>People and institutions often have to make decisions about undertakings where the costs and benefits are spread out over tie. For instance, a person acquiring an automobile or home is confronted with a large initial outlay. The outlay can be financed by agreeing to pay amounts in the future, often over a span of many years.</p>
<p>Another example: Students today are acutely aware of climate change and the importance of taking preventive or mitigating actions such as discouraging fossil fuel production, investing in renewable sources of energy and the infrastructure for using them effectively, and exploring active measures such as carbon sequestration. The costs and benefits of such actions are spread out over decades, with the costs coming sooner than the benefits. Policy makers are often and perhaps correctly criticized for overvaluing present-day costs and undervaluing benefits that accrue mainly to successive generations. There are many analogous situations on a smaller scale, such as setting Social Security taxes and benefits or the problem of underfunded pension systems and the liability for pension payments deferred to future taxpayers.]</p>
<p>The conventional mechanism for condensing an extended time stream of benefits and costs is called <strong><em>discounting</em></strong>. Discounting is based on the logic of financing expenditures via borrowing at interest. For example, credit cards are a familiar mechanism for financing purchases by delaying the payment of money until the future. A common occurance is that an expense that is too large to bear is “carried” on a credit card so that it can be paid off as funds become available. This incurs costs due to <strong><em>interest</em></strong> on the credit-card balance. Typical credit-card interest rates are 18-30% per year.</p>
<p>As notation, consider a time stream of money <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}(t)\)</span>. The big conceptual leap is to understand that the <strong><em>present value</em></strong> of money, that is, the value in terms of a unit of money that we have right now, is not constant. Let’s denote the present value function <span class="math inline">\({\cal V}_r(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a parameter. The total present value—generally called the <strong><em>net present value</em></strong>—of the time stream of money is
<span class="math display">\[\int_\text{now}^\text{forever} {\cal C}(t) {\cal V}_r(t)\, dt\ .\]</span>
It’s conventional to define <span class="math inline">\({\cal V}_r(t)\)</span> on the basis of bank interest. We stipulate that the present value of that <span class="math inline">\({\cal V}_r(0) = 1\)</span>, which is to say that the present value of $1 that we have in hand right now is exactly 1 dollar.</p>
<p>Suppose that a bank offers to lend you money at an interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> per month. To receive from them 1 dollar now entails that you pay the bank <span class="math inline">\(1+r\)</span> dollars at the end of the month. A rational decision maker would undertake this transaction only if there was not a loss in it, that is, if the present value of <span class="math inline">\(1+r\)</span> dollars in a month is less than or equal to the present value of 1 dollar now. Or, more generally,
<span class="math display">\[(1+r)^t \ {\cal V}_r(t) \leq  {\cal V}_r(0) = 1\ .\]</span> By this logic, <span class="math display">\[{\cal V}(t)\ \  =\ \   \frac{1}{(1+r)^t} = (1+r)^{-t}\ .\]</span>
Thus, the present value function <span class="math inline">\({\cal V}_r(t)\)</span> is an exponentially decaying function of time. Since we’re used to using a parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in exponential functions, we’ll write the present value function as <span class="math display">\[{\cal V}_r(t) = e^{-k t} = (1+r)^{-t}\ .\]</span> The last equality provides a way to determine the numerical value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from the specified <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>The reason it’s preferable to use <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> has to do with compounding of interest. Being told <span class="math inline">\(r=2\%\)</span> per month is not quite the entire story. You also have to know how often the interest is compounded. For instance, it’s natural (but wrong!) to believe that 2% per month is the same as 24% per year. But it depends on how often the interest is compounded. If it is compounded every month, the present value of one dollar at the end of a year is <span class="math inline">\({\cal V}_r(t= 1\ \text{year}) = (1+r)^{12}\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(r = 2\%\)</span> per month, that comes to <span class="math inline">\(1.02^{12} = 1.2682\)</span>. In other words, the effective annual rate is 26.82%. If you round off 2% per month to 24% per year, you will be underestimating the amount you owe by about 10%.</p>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(e^{kt}\)</span> format, all you need to know is the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and its units. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will match a rate of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> per month when <span class="math inline">\(e^{kt} = (1+r)^t\)</span>, in other words <span class="math inline">\(k = \ln(1+r)\)</span> per month. Whereas multiplying <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> by 12 will not convert a monthly rate into an annual rate, things are much simpler with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For instance, for <span class="math inline">\(r=2\%\)</span> per month, <span class="math inline">\(k = \ln(1.02) = 0.019803\)</span> per month. The <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> corresponding to 12 months is a unit conversion: “per month” into “per year”. Of course, 1 per month is the same quantity as 12 per year, so multiply 0.0198 per month by 12 months/year to get <span class="math inline">\(12 \times 0.0198 = 0.2376\)</span> per year. In this way of reckoning, the amount you owe after one year is <span class="math inline">\(\exp(0.2376\ \text{per year} \times 1\ \text{year}) = 1.2682\)</span>.</p>
<div class="intheworld">
<p>Suppose you decide to buy a product that costs <span class="math inline">\(\$\cal P\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(\cal P=\)</span> $10,000 for a used car. Let’s say you need the car for your new job, but you don’t have the money. So you borrow it.</p>
<p>Your plan is to pay an amount <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> each month for 30 months—the next <span class="math inline">\(2\,\small\frac{1}{2}\)</span> years. What should that rate be?</p>
<p>You can put the purchase on your credit card at an interest rate of <span class="math inline">\(r=2\%\)</span> per month. This corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(k = \ln(1+r) = 0.0198\)</span> per month. The net present value of your payments over 30 months at a rate of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> per month will be
<span class="math display">\[\int_0^{30} A {\cal V}_r(t)\, dt = \int_0^{30} e^{-kt} A = -\frac{A}{k} e^{-kt}\left.{\Large\strut}\right|_{t=0}^{30}\\ =- A \left(\strut \frac{e^{-30k}}{k} - \frac{e^{-0k}}{k} \right) = - A\left(\strut27.88 - 50.50\right) = 22.62 A\]</span>
For <span class="math inline">\(22.62 A = {\cal P}\)</span>, your monthly payment on the $10,000 car will be $10,000/22.62 or $442.09.</p>

<p>The Powerball is a weekly lottery famous for its outsized payoff. For instance, for the week of April 7, 2021, the jackpot payout was officially described as $43,000,000. But they don’t really mean this.</p>
<p>After withholding taxes, the supposed $43,000,000 amounts to $17,161,778 as a one time cash payment, or, alternatively, 30 annual payments of $873,711. (The tax numbers are for Colorado.) We want to find the discount rate that is implicit in the equating of $17M now with 30 payments of $875,000.</p>
<p>Discounted at a continuously compounded rate of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the net present value of a 30-year payment stream of $875K per year is <span class="math display">\[\text{NPV}(k) = \int_0^{30} e^{-kt}\ \$875000\, dt\ .\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Under Construction</strong></p>
<p>Content subject to revision.</p>
</div>
<p>We have records of large earthquakes going back 1000’s of years, at least in those parts of the world that kept written records. In regions with mainly oral traditions, stories of historical earthquakes are treated with skepticism.</p>
<p>For instance, in California written records reach about 400 years into the past. Anticipating a future earthquakes is an everyday matter in California and governments in seismically active zones have prepared by means of building codes and emergency precautions. A bit further up the US West Coast, in the Cascadia region of Oregon, there is a shorter written record and, until the last 30-40 years, little realization that the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oem/Documents/01_ORP_Cascadia.pdf">area has been subject to profoundly powerful earthquakes</a> called “great quakes.” There are great quakes in living memory: the 2004 Boxing Day earthquake centered on Sumatra that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan that killed tens of thousands and led to the meltdown of nuclear power plants in Fukashima. Both of these were magnitude 9.1. Even larger were the 1964 9.2 magnitude quake in southern Alaska and the magnitude 9.5 Valdivia earthquake in Chile in 1960. The local magnitude scale is logarithmic, so a 9.5 magnitude quake releases about 3 times the energy of a 9.1 magnitude quake.</p>
<p>This exercise explores a model to inform the extent to which it’s worth preparing for such quakes in order to prevent material damage. The risk to life is another important matter. But feasible investments in the build environment can minimize the direct impact of earthquakes to human life. Tsunamis generated by quakes are another matter, for which the only effective mitigating precautions are the development of evacuation routes and procedures and relocation of building away from the affected zone.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a situation in which $100 spent in precautions such as strengthening building construction would generate $1000 in savings in the event of a major earthquake. (This ratio is made up for demonstration purposes, but you can easily substitute a better substantiated estimate.) From a societal point of view, many people would see the investment as clearly worthwhile. But we’re going to take a more technical point of view that incorporates two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The $100 is to be spent today, while the $1000 savings will occur in the future. This can be handled by simple discounting.</li>
<li>The time until the earthquake is unknown, although reasonable probability models are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time of the last great Cascadia Zone earthquake is known with surprising precision: January 26, 1700. Before this, dates are estimated from geologic evidence. The figure shows the known history of Cascadia Zone earthquakes. <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oem/Documents/01_ORP_Cascadia.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p><img src="www/earthquake-timeline.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>A standard model for the interval between earthquakes of a given magnitude is the exponential distribution. For the great quakes in the Cascadia Zone, the average interval between consecutive quakes is about 300 years and the corresponding exponential probability distribution is <span class="math display">\[\frac{e^{t/300}}{300}\]</span> The sandbox is set up to make a graph of this distribution and enables other calculations you will need later.</p>
<p>As shown by the definite integral already coded in the sandbox, the total probability of an earthquake at some point in the future is, according to the model, 100%. So this is a model of <em>when</em> an earthquake will occur, not <em>whether</em> one will occur.</p>

<p>Almost everyone who meets the exponential probability model is surprised that the density is highest at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0^+\)</span>, that is, immediately after the previous quake.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> By using the appropriate definite integral, find the probability for earthquakes separated on average by 300 years (this essentially means using the provided model in the code) that the actual interval from the last quake will be less than 30 years. Which percentage is closest?</p>
<p>    <span class="Zchoice">2%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">10%<span class="mcanswer"><span class="math inline">\(\heartsuit\ \)</span></span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">20%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">25%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> Similarly to the previous question, find the probability that the actual interval from the last quake will be more than 500 years. (Hint: Be thoughful about what the limits of integration will be.)</p>
<p>    <span class="Zchoice">2%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">10%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">20%<span class="mcanswer"><span class="math inline">\(\heartsuit\ \)</span></span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">25%<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></p>
<p>An astounding and counter-intuitive aspect of the exponential model is that the same probability density describes the time from <strong>now</strong> to the eventual earthquake. In other words, it doesn’t matter how long it’s been since the last earthquake.</p>
<p>Now let’s put together our model of the net present value of an expenditure on earthquake preparedness. As you recall, the net present value of <span class="math inline">\(\$10\)</span> to be paid <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> years from the present is <span class="math inline">\(10 e^{-r t}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the continuously compounded interest rate. For the example, we’ll set <span class="math inline">\(r=7.8\%\)</span>, as we did in the Powerball example.</p>
<p>Of course <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is uncertain, so there’s no definite answer for the net present value of earthquake preparedness. However, since we have a model of the probability of the earthquake occuring as a function of the interval <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we can find the <strong>expectation value</strong> of the net present value of earthquake preparedness.</p>
<p>For continuous probability densities (such as the exponential earthquake interval model) an expectation value is the definite integral over all possibilities of the probability density times the eventual outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> Using the information presented above about the probability density function and the net present value, which of the following is appropriate for calculation of the net present value of $10 spent today for earthquake preparedness?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{300} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-0.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\)</span><span class="mcanswer">Good. </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{10}{300} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-1.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(100 \int_{0}^{300} e^{-1.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{300} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-7.8 t} e^{-t/300}dt\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>The integral gives only the net present value of the eventual benefit of earthquake preparedness. If this is larger than today’s expenditure, the expenditure is economically worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> What is the numerical value (in dollars) of the correct integral from the previous question?</p>
<p>    <span class="Zchoice">0.43<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">4.10<span class="mcanswer"><span class="math inline">\(\heartsuit\ \)</span></span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">14.80<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">34.50<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD THE DISCOUNT RATE BE IF YOU BELIEVE THE SAFETY MEASURES ARE WORTHWHILE?</p>
<p>We used an average time between earthquakes of 300 years, as seem appropriate for the Cascadia Zone earthquake history. The net present value of the eventual reduction in damages was small, too small to justify the expenditure on economic grounds.</p>
<p>Modify the code in the above sandbox to perform the calculation for different earthquakes, say with an average interval of 50 years or 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>Question E</strong> What’s the longest average interval that generates a net present value of the damage reduction of <span class="math inline">\(\$10\)</span>, enough to justify the expenditure? Pick the closest one. (Hint: You can try out expectation value integral using the average intervals given as choices in place of the 300-year interval originally used.)</p>
<p>    <span class="Zchoice">25 years<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">50 years<span class="mcanswer"><span class="math inline">\(\heartsuit\ \)</span></span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">100 years<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span>       <span class="Zchoice">150 years<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></p>
<p>WARNING. You should not come away from this exercise with the idea that <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.078\)</span> is the “right” discount rate. We used that rate in this exercise only because there is documented evidence that some group of people—the sorts of investors who buy 30-year TIPS—currently act as if that were their discount rate. An individual is entitled to set his or her own discount rate based on any rationale whatsoever. (That said, the interest rate you could make long term on an investment readily available to you can reasonably be taken as the baseline.)</p>
<p>When it comes to groups of people, the appropriate discount rate becomes a matter of opinion and disagreement. In particular, there is a concept called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_discount_rate">“social discount rate”</a>. Regretably, there is no clear basis for picking this other than to put it in the range 0 to about 7%. Net present value is therefore a dubious criterion for making decisions whose impact will be felt in the long term, over generations. This is the case, for instance, with global warmi</p>

Guatemala          | 5               |  74
Finland            | 10              |  82
Germany            | 11              |  81

Latvia             | 15              |  75
Lebanon            | 4               |  79
Norway             | 8               |  83
Sudan              | 7               |  65
Sweden             | 9               |  83
Syria              | 5               |  73
United Kingdom     | 9               |  81
United States      | 9               |  79
Venezuela          | 7               |  72
West Bank and Gaza | 3               |  74
Yemen              | 6               |  66

Scan the list carefully. You may be surprised to see some poor countries with active civil strife---Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Palestinian territories---with low death rates compared to rich countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan. The reason for this pattern is that wealth and strife are not the major determinants of the risk of death. The major one, the mother of all risk factors, is age. Older people are far more likely to die than younger people.
