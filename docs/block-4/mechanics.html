<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 31</span> Mechanics</h1>
<p>In Block 2, we introduced the ideas of <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> and <strong><em>infinitesimal</em></strong> intervals of time. These are mathematical concepts introduced in the 17th century for describing motion. (In the 16th century, Galileo’s measurements of motion involved averages over <strong><em>finite</em></strong> time intervals.) With this new mathematical tool, Newton was able to propose and confirm <strong><em>laws of motion</em></strong>. Velocity of an object is its instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time. Acceleration of an object is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time. With these abstract concepts, Newton was able to connect motion to the palpable <strong><em>forces</em></strong> acting on objects. Thus was born the field of <strong><em>dynamics</em></strong>, the study of forces and their effects on motion. A dynamic process is one that is characterized by constant change: motion.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong><em>statics</em></strong> is about physical systems that do not change. A non-changing system is said to be in <strong><em>equilibrium</em></strong> or balance. Static systems are incredibly important in everyday life; a bridge that is not static is one that you do not want to cross! The equilibrium in a bridge is the balance between the downward force of gravity and the compression and tensile forces in the materials that make up the bridge.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mechanics</em></strong> a catch-all term for the combination of statics and dynamics studied in physics and used in engineering and design. Today it’s common to think of a “mechanic” as a person who works with machines; the sense we have in mind here is the <strong><em>study of machines</em></strong>, with the “-ic” signifying “practice of” in the sense of scientific, physics, mathematics, optics, chiropractic, and such.</p>
<p>“Simple machine” is a Renaissance-era term for a device that changes the direction or strength of forces. The classical simple machines are the lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. “Mechanics” as a field originated in the study of such devices and development of theoretical concepts to describe them. It went on to deal with more complicated machine components such as a gas-filled cylinder and piston, flywheel, valve, turbine, etc. Many concepts from these theory are intuitive to the modern mind: force, pressure, momentum.</p>
<p>This chapter is about the role of calculus concepts and methods, especially the calculus of accumulation/integration are applied in mechanics.</p>
<div id="work" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.1</span> Work</h2>
<p>“Work” is a familiar, everyday concept, but a nuanced one; one person’s work can be another person’s play. In mechanics, <strong><em>work</em></strong> has a much more specific meaning stemming from the study of simple machines. A lever, for instance, can be used to move an object that is otherwise too heavy to handle. It still takes toil and effort to move the object, but the effort is eased by the mechanics of the lever.</p>
<p>Our intuitive sense of work is perhaps rooted in physiology: effort, fatigue, muscle pain. For instance, it takes work to pick up a heavy object, but it is also work to hold the object up even without moving it. Generations of thinking about machines has brought us to a different notion of work that doesn’t involve human subjectivity. In mechanics, holding an object steady, no matter how heavy, does not involve work. Although a human tasked to hold a heavy load will become exhausted, the same duty can be accomplished by placing the load on a table, completely eliminating the effort. In mechanics, work and motion go hand in hand; without motion there is no work.</p>
<p>The table holding the heavy load does no work. Work is done only when the load is moved, and the amount of work depends on how the load is moved. For instance, moving a block along level ground involves a lot of work, but pulling a cart filled with blocks can be almost effortless. In mechanics, work combines both the amount of motion and the force needed to accomplish the motion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work is force times displacement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider, for instance, the work involved in lifting a mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to table height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="www/mass-on-table.png" width="15%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The lifting is accomplished by applying an upward force to counter the force of gravity. The gravitational force on the mass is <span class="math inline">\(m g\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the instantaneous acceleration of an object released to fall freely (about 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> near the Earth’s surface). The distance traveled is <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. So the work performed on the mass is <span class="math inline">\(m g h\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that the work has nothing to do with the <strong>speed</strong> with which the mass is moved up to the table. Lift it fast or lift it slow, it amounts to the same mechanical work. (Of course, to human perception, lifting an object very slowly up to table height involves more effort than snapping it up quickly. But human effort is only peripherally related to mechanical work.)</p>
<p>Let’s introduce a machine to the situation in the form of a ramp or a pulley. The purpose of the machine is to ease human labor by changing the strength or direction of forces. You can perhaps intuit that rolling the mass up the ramp will be an easier task than lifting it. How so?</p>
<p><img src="www/mass-up-ramp.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The ramp can be seen as a sort of partial table. The ramp does most of what’s needed to hold the mass up, the human worker need only supply a modest additional force, parallel to the ramp surface, to keep the mass in place. Calculating that modest additional force can be accomplished by a basic mathematical technique in mechanics: <strong><em>decomposing a vector</em></strong>.</p>
<p>You’ve already encountered vectors (in Section 24.3) in the context of the <strong><em>gradient vector</em></strong>, the vector that points in the steepest uphill direction of a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> at any given input <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>. Recall that the gradient vector was written as a set of values; the partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> with respect to each of its inputs in turn. That is, <span class="math display">\[\nabla f(x,y) = \left({\large\strut} \partial_x f(x,y),\ \  \partial_y f(x,y)\right)\ .\]</span> In this representation, the vector <span class="math inline">\(\nabla f(x, y)\)</span> is decomposed into two components: <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x,y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_y f(x,y)\)</span>. Similarly, we can decompose the vector of gravitational force into two components, one along the surface of the ramp and the other perpendicular to the ramp.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:ramp-decomposition"></span>
<img src="www/ramp-decomposition.png" alt="Decomposing the vector of gravitational force into two, perpendicular components, one tangent to the ramp and the other perpendicular to it." width="35%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 31.1: Decomposing the vector of gravitational force into two, perpendicular components, one tangent to the ramp and the other perpendicular to it.
</p>
</div>
<p>We’ll return to the idea of vector decomposition in much more detail in Block 5 of this course; it has a major (though perhaps unexpected) role to play in fitting models to data. But for now, we’ll simply examine the right triangle in Figure <a href="mechanics.html#fig:ramp-decomposition">31.1</a>. In that triangle, the gravitational force vector <span class="math inline">\(F_{gravity} = m g\)</span> is in the role of the hypothenuse. The component along the ramp is <span class="math inline">\(m \sin(\theta) g\)</span>. The worker pushing the mass up the ramp need provide the fraction <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\theta)\)</span> as much force as the worker picking up the mass without a ramp. Thus human effort is reduced by the machine.</p>
<p>What about the mechanical work? Is that also reduced? Remember that mechanical work is the product of force times distance. The force has been reduced to <span class="math inline">\(m \sin(\theta) g\)</span>, but the distance <span class="math inline">\(D_{ramp}\)</span> along the ramp is much longer than the distance <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> from floor to table top.</p>
<p><img src="www/ramp-triangle.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Again, referring to the ramp itself as a right triangle, you can see that <span class="math inline">\(D_{ramp}\sin(\theta) = h\)</span> or, <span class="math inline">\(D_{ramp} = h / \sin(\theta)\)</span>. The total mechanical work, the product of applied force times distance moved is <span class="math display">\[m \sin(\theta) g \times D_{ramp} = m \sin(\theta) g \times \frac{h}{\sin(\theta)} = m g h\ .\]</span> The ramp does nothing to reduce the mechanical work needed to lift the mass!</p>
<p>We usually think of ramps as an inclined plane. But, from Blocks 1 to 3 we have the tools to figure out the work for a (smooth) ramp with any shape at all. We’re going to do this not because odd-shaped ramps are encountered frequently, but to provide an example in a relatively familiar setting of some techniques we will use elsewhere in this chapter.</p>
<p>The ramp we have in mind has a surface whose height <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is zero at the foot (<span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span>) and reaches <span class="math inline">\(f(x=b) = h\)</span> where it joins the table. The slope of the ramp is, as you know, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span>. It’s helpful to convert this rise/run formulation of slope into the slope-angle form we used to study the simple ramp. [Zoomed in theta diagram here.] As you can see from the diagram, which zooms in on one place on the ramp, rise over run amounts to <span class="math inline">\(L\sin(\theta) / L\cos(\theta) = \partial_x f(x) = \tan(\theta)\)</span>, with the result:
<span class="math display">\[\theta = \arctan({\large\strut}\partial_x f(x))\ .\]</span>
Consequently, the force that needs to be applied parallel to the ramp’s surface is <span class="math inline">\(m \sin(\arctan(\partial_x f(x))) g = m \sin(theta) g\)</span>. To find the work done in pushing the mass an infinitesimal distance along the ramp we need to know the <strong><em>instantaneous length</em></strong> of the ramp. This is potentially confusing to the new reader since we’ve already said that the distance is infinitesimal. But as you know, infinitesimal length is different from zero length. We’ll write <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> as an infinitesimal increment along the floor, but the zoomed-in surface of the ramp is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg has length <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> and the other has length slope times distance or <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x) dx\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="www/ramp-segment.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The hypotenuse of the infinitesimal segment of the ramp has length
<span class="math inline">\(dL = \sqrt{\strut dx + \partial_x f(x) dx}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(dL = \sqrt{\strut 1 + \partial_x f(x)}\ dx\)</span>. Things are a bit simpler if we write <span class="math inline">\(dL\)</span> in terms of the slope angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(dx = \cos(\theta) dL\)</span>, we know <span class="math inline">\(dL = dx/\cos(\theta)\)</span>. Consequently the infinitesimal of work is <span class="math display">\[dW \ = \ m g \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\ dx\  = \ m g \tan(\theta) dx \ .\]</span>
The total work is the accumulation of <span class="math inline">\(dW\)</span> over the extent of the ramp.

From the “fundamental theorem of calculus” we know that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_a^b m g\ \partial_x f(x)\ dx \ = \ \left.m g \ f(x){\Large\strut}\right|_a^b = mg \left[\strut f(b) - f(a)\right] = mg h\ .\]</span></p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that pushing the mass up the <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>-shaped ramp involves an amount of work, <span class="math inline">\(m g h\)</span>, that <em>does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span></em>, only on <span class="math inline">\(f(b) - f(a)\)</span>, the net height comprised by the ramp.</p>
<p>We haven’t yet said what this notion of work is good for and we’ve given no detailed justification for the definition of mechanical work as force times distance. You could imagine, for instance, someone deciding to measure work as the square-root of force times distance squared. But … that particular measure is not going to make sense if we think about the dimension of the quantity. Force has dimension [force] = M L T<sup>-2</sup>. Square root of force times length squared would have dimension [sqrt(force) <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> length-squared] = M<sup>1/2</sup> L<sup>5/2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>. The non-integer exponents mean that this is not a legitimate physical quantity.</p>
<p>The dimension of force-times-length are straightforward: [force <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> length] = M L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>, that is, <strong><em>energy</em></strong>. The particular definition of work as force times length will make sense in the context of a more comprehensive mechanical theory of energy. The significance of energy itself is that, as a fundamental proposition of physics, the various forms of energy are interchangeable but <strong><em>conserved</em></strong>; energy is neither created nor destroyed, just moved around from one form to another and one place to another.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.2</span> Energy</h2>
<p>Mechanical work, as discussed in the previous section, is a form of energy. When we lift a object, we put energy into the object. But we cannot say from examining the object how much work was done to place it on the table. That depends on how the object came to be on the table: lifted from the floor (positive work; force is positive upward, displacement is also positive upward) or perhaps lowered from a helicopter (negative work: force exerted by the cable is positive upward but the displacement is downward, therefore negative). We might call the work energy <strong><em>latent</em></strong>, the word meaning “unobservable,” “hidden,” “concealed,” “dormant.” To have an operational meaning, the work-energy that we assign to an object at rest must be with respect to some “ground state.” A convenient ground state here is to imagine the object resting on the ground. The assigned energy will then be the work that would have to be performed to raise the object to table height. Once at table height, the energy is again latent.</p>
<p>How then to <em>measure</em> the work energy that’s latent in the object resting on the table? The idea is to return the object to its ground state, which we could do by lowering it—a negative displacement—to the ground, measuring the force needed to support the object (upward, so positive) and multiplying this by the displacement.</p>
<p>Another idea for measuring the latent energy is to let the object fall freely back toward its ground state and see what changes about the object. Perhaps you have already caught on to what will happen: the object’s speed increases steadily until the instant before it hits the ground.</p>
<p>“Latent” is an apt but unusual word to express the energy imbued in the object resting on the table. We might equally say that the energy is “associated with position (at the height the table),” or we could call it “gravitational energy.” The term that’s generally used is a near synonym of “latent.” We call the energy of the stationary object on the table <strong><em>potential energy.</em></strong> More precisely it can be called <strong><em>gravitational potential energy</em></strong> to distinguish it from the potential energy created by other forms of work, for instance pulling apart magnets or electric charges or compressing a gas into a cylinder.</p>
<p>There’s also a form of energy associated with motion. We could call this “energy of motion,” but the conventional term is <strong><em>kinetic energy</em></strong>. (A dictionary definition of “kinetic” is “relating to or resulting from motion.” so we might as well say simply that kinetic energy is "energy relating to motion.)</p>
<p>Velocity is a good way to observe motion. We can use dimensional analysis to anticipate how velocity and (kinetic) energy are related. Recall that energy has dimension M L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup> and velocity has dimension L/T. Consequently, if an object’s kinetic energy at any instant stems from its mass and its velocity, then the energy must be mass times velocity squared, perhaps multiplied by a scalar, that is:
<span class="math display">\[E_{kinetic} = a m v^2\ .\]</span></p>
<p>To find this scalar, we’ll use calculus and accumulation. We know that the acceleration of a free-falling object due to gravity is <span class="math inline">\(-g\)</span> (where the negative sign reflects the downward direction). Starting from rest (that is zero velocity so zero kinetic energy) the newly released mass will have a velocity that is the accumulated acceleration over time. In other words:
<span class="math display">\[v(t) = \int_0^t - g\ dt = -\left.g \ t{\large\strut}\right|_0^t = -g\ t\ .\]</span>
Correspondingly, the position at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will be the accumulated velocity:
<span class="math display">\[x(t) = x(t=0) + \int_0^t v(t) dt = h  + \int_0^t -g\ t\ dt = h - \frac{1}{2} \left.g\ t^2{\Large\strut}\right|_0^t = h - \frac{1}{2} g\ t^2 \ .\]</span>
The position is relevant only because we want to figure out the velocity at precisely the instant <span class="math inline">\(t_g\)</span> when the object returns to its ground state, <span class="math inline">\(x(t_g)=0\)</span>. By plugging in <span class="math inline">\(t=t_g\)</span> to the above, and re-arranging, we find that the object returns to its ground state when <span class="math inline">\(h - \frac{1}{2} g\ t_g^2 = 0\ \ \ \implies \ \ \ t_g = \sqrt{\strut 2 h/g}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that we know the time when the object reaches its ground state, we can calculate the velocity at that instant:
<span class="math display">\[v(t_g) = -g\ t_g = - g\ \sqrt{\strut 2 h / g} = - \sqrt{\strut 2 g h}\]</span>
As the object reaches its ground state, its gravitation potential energy is zero (because it’s at the ground state) and, if energy is conserved and assuming that no other forms of energy are relevant but kinetic and gravitational potential energy, the kinetic energy will be the same size as the potential energy at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> when the object was released from the table, that is
<span class="math display">\[E_{kinetic}(t_g) = a\ m\ v(t_g)^2 =
= a\ m \left(\sqrt{\strut 2 g h\ }\ \right)^2 = \\\ \\2\, a\, m\, g\, h\  = m\, g\, h = E_{potential}(t=0)\]</span></p>

<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-9" class="example"><strong>Example 31.2  </strong></span>In the previous section, we calculated the potential energy of a 1 kg object at an altitude of 10,000 km above the Earth’s surface: 37,405,840 J.

<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2} (1 \text{kg}) v^2 = 37,405,840 \text{J} = 37,405,840 \ \text{kg}\ \text{m}^2\ \text{t}^{-2}\]</span>

<p>The photograph (<a href="https://www.coachmag.co.uk/exercises/dumbbell-exercises">source</a>) shows a simple exercise: holding a dumbbell out horizontally.</p>
<p><img src="www/barbell-exercise.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As anyone who does this exercise can tell you, even when there is no movement of the dumbbell, there is a strong sense of work being done. Your muscle fatigues and, for most people, the dumbbells can be held in place for only a short time.</p>
<p>We’ve said that mechanical work always involves motion; no motion, no work. So how come the exercise feels like work even though the hands do not move?</p>
<p>To perform the exercise, you contract the muscles of the shoulder and upper arm. There is no skeletal joint that can be locked in place (unlike, say, the knee). It is only the muscle force that holds the arms in place.</p>
<p>On the size scale that we normally perceive, it can appear that nothing is moving during the exercise. But zoom in to the molecular scale to see the action by which force is generated by muscle. The functional unit of muscle force involves two proteins, actin and myosin, that interact in a complicated way. The animation (from the online textbook by Michael D. Mann, <a href="https://michaeldmann.net/The%20Nervous%20System%20In%20Action.html"><em>The Nervous System in Action</em></a>, <a href="https://michaeldmann.net/mann14.html">chapter 14</a>) shows the situation. The “head” of a myosin unit (red) acts like an oar. It attaches to a site on the actin molecule (orange) causing the head to contract and pull on the actin. Once contracted, a molecule of ATP (green sphere) binds to the myosin, releasing the head and preparing it for another stroke. ATP is an organic molecule that serves as a primary energy carrier and is found in all known forms of life. Transformation of ATP to ADP releases the energy. The ADP is then cycled, though other metabolic processes, back into ATP. This happens rapidly. Humans recycle approximately their own body weight in ATP each day.</p>

</div>
<p>When muscle is under tension, the actin can slip back in between strokes of the myosin head. Thus, a constant-length muscle in tension on a macroscopic scale is steadily consuming energy, in much the same way as an oarsman on an anchored boat can do work via the movement of oars against the water even when the boat itself is not moving.</p>

<div id="momentum" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.3</span> Momentum</h2>
<p>In the previous sections we looked at force <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> distance. Dimensional analysis showed that [force <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> distance] = <a href="mechanics.html#energy">energy</a> and, in the setting of lifting an object and letting it fall back toward its ground state, we traced out the conversion of the energy of position (“potential energy”) into the energy of velocity (“kinetic energy”).</p>
<p>Now consider a somewhat different quantity: force <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> time. Dimensional analysis gives
<span class="math display">\[\underbrace{M^1 L^1 \ T^{-2}}_\text{[force]}\  \times\ \underbrace{T}_\text{[time]} = \underbrace{M^1}_\text{[mass]} \underbrace{L^1 T^{-1}}_\text{[velocity]} \]</span>
The product of force times time is dimensionally equivalent to the product of mass times velocity. The quantity is called <strong><em>momentum</em></strong>. Newton’s second law of motion, often written in terms of acceleration, <span class="math inline">\(F = m a\)</span>, is more fundamentally written in terms of momentum: <span class="math inline">\(F = \partial_t\, m\, v\)</span>. The <strong><em>conservation of momentum</em></strong> refers to the situation when outside forces on a system are nil. In such case, momentum of the system doesn’t change with time; momentum is constant or “conserved.”</p>
<p>An example of such a system is a deep-space probe, sufficiently far from other matter that gravitational force is negligible. In order to speed up or slow down (or turn), the probe is made to throw out fast moving molecules of burnt fuel. These particles have “new” momentum, but since momentum of the whole system is conserved, the body of the probe gains “new” momentum in the opposite direction. This is the operating principle of the rocket engine.</p>

<p>Aircraft jet engines work in a similar matter, burning fuel to create energy. Whereas the force generated by a rocket engine is entirely produced by the newly created momentum of the burnt fuel, aircraft engines have an additional material to work with: air. The earliest jet engines, <strong><em>turbojet engines</em></strong>, were small in diameter, bringing in air mainly as a fuel for combustion. (Figure <a href="#fig:jet-engines"><strong>??</strong></a> left<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Today’s more efficient engines are large diameter: <strong><em>turbofan engines</em></strong>. (Figure <a href="#fig:jet-engines"><strong>??</strong></a> right<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>) In addition to using air for combustion, they use large fan blades to convert the energy of combustion into a large mass of relatively slowly moving, uncombusted air. This moving air carries momentum; more than that contained in the fast moving particles generated directly through combustion.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.4</span> Center of mass</h2>
<p>In considering a physical object of extended shape, it can be a great simplification to be able to treat the whole extended object as if it were a simple point object at a single location. For instance, Figure <a href="mechanics.html#fig:galaxy-probe">31.5</a> imagines a space probe coasting through the edge of a galaxy.</p>

<p>What is the gravitational attraction of the galaxy on the probe? One way to find this is by adding up the individual gravitational attractions of the individual stars. Another is to find the center of mass of the galaxy and calculate the force <em>as if</em> all the mass were at that point. The two calculations give the same answer.</p>
<p>For the galaxy, the center of mass is located at a point <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x},\bar{y})\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[\bar{x} \equiv \sum_\text{galaxy} m_i x_i\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \bar{y} \equiv \sum_\text{galaxy} m_i y_i\]</span></p>

<p>For a continuous shape, such as in Figure <a href="mechanics.html#fig:shape1">31.6</a> (left) we can describe the center-of-mass calculation as finding <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\)</span> such that

where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> refers to the whole object and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>A is a differential of the object, that is, a tiny piece of the object.

<span class="math display">\[M = \int_\text{A} \rho(x,y)\ d\text{A}\]</span></p>
<p>There are many ways to split an object up into differential pieces so that they can be accumulated to give the whole integral. One simple way, shown in Figure <a href="mechanics.html#fig:shape1">31.6</a> (right), is to
divide the object into a set of discrete, non-overlapping, adjacent rectangles (or cubes for a three-dimensional object). Then, as with adding up the stars, just add up <span class="math inline">\(x \rho(x, y) d\)</span>A or <span class="math inline">\(y \rho(x,y) d\)</span>A contained in each of the rectangular <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>A regions.

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> component of the center of mass, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> is computed almost identically, but substituting <span class="math inline">\(10*y ~ x &amp; y\)</span> as the function to be integrated.

<div id="angular-momentum-and-torque" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.5</span> Angular momentum and torque</h2>
<p>The relationship between force and momentum is familiar:
<span class="math display">\[F = \partial_t\, m\, v =\ \underbrace{m \ \partial_t\  v}_\text{if mass is constant}\ .\]</span> Of course, the derivative of velocity with respect to time is also called “acceleration.”</p>
<p>Consider the following situation. A space probe is being acted on by a constant force, as in Figure <a href="#fig:probe-constant"><strong>??</strong></a>. The mass of the probe is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the thrust from the rocket engine (red triangle) provides the force <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Starting from velocity <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t y(t=0)\)</span> and position <span class="math inline">\(y(t=0) = 0\)</span>, the thrust produces an acceleration <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{tt} y(t) = F/m\)</span>. Integrating the acceleration gives the velocity as a function of time
<span class="math display" id="eq:y-dot">\[\begin{equation}
\partial_t y(t) = \frac{F}{m} t\ .
\tag{31.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Our task is to translate the <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span>-position into an angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> as seen from the planet so that we can find the equation of motion in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, that is
<span class="math display">\[\partial_{tt} \theta(t) = {\Large ?}\]</span></p>
<p>The derivation of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{tt} \theta(t)\)</span> will perhaps not be obvious, but you should be able to follow the role of calculus operations in each step. We’ll write it in terms of the constants <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and the functions <span class="math inline">\(D(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y(t) = \frac{F}{m}t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the probe’s starting point, the planet’s position, and the probe’s position at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> form a right triangle. The length of the horizontal leg of the triangle is constant: <span class="math inline">\(D(0)\)</span> which, for brevity, we’ll write <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span>. The vertical leg has length <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span>, and the hypotenuse has length <span class="math inline">\(D(t)\)</span>. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that <span class="math display">\[D(t)^2 = y(t)^2 + D_0^2\ .\]</span> Note also a fact from trigonometry:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D(t=0) = D(t) \cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)\ \ \implies\ \ D(t) = \frac{D_0}{\cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)}\]</span></p>
<p>Step 1: Differentiate both sides with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\partial_t \left[\strut D(t)^2\right] = \partial_t \left[\strut y(t)^2\right] \ \]</span> where we’ve used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> is a constant and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t \left[\strut D_0^2 \right] = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step 2: Applying the chain rule to both sides gives <span class="math display">\[2\, D(t)\, \partial_t D(t) = 2\, y(t)\ \partial_t y(t)\ \ \implies\ \ \partial_t y(t) = \frac{D(t)}{y(t)}\,\partial_t D(t)\ .\]</span> Re-arranging terms and using the trigonometric fact <span class="math inline">\(y(t) = D(t) \sin\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[\partial_t y(t) = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\strut \theta(t)\right)}\, \partial_t D(t)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>Step 3: We know from trigonometry that <span class="math inline">\(D(t) = D_0/\cos(\theta(t))\)</span>. Differentiate both sides with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to get another form for <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t D(t)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t D(t) = D_0\, \partial_t \frac{1}{\cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)} = D_0 \frac{\sin\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)}{\cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)^2}\, \partial_t \theta(t)\]</span></p>
<p>Step 4: Combining the results from Steps 2 and 3, we have
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t y(t) = \frac{F}{m}\,t = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)}D_0 \frac{\sin\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)}{\cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)^2}\, \partial_t \theta(t) \\= \frac{D_0}{\cos\left(\strut \theta(t)\right)^2} \partial_t\,\theta(t) = D(t)^2\, \partial_t \theta(t)\]</span>
Again re-arranging, <span class="math display">\[\frac{F D_0}{m}\,t =  \left[{\Large\strut}\frac{D_0}{\cos\left(\strut\theta(t)\right)}\right]^2 \partial_t \theta(t) = D(t)^2 \partial_t \theta(t)\]</span> so
<span class="math display" id="eq:theta-dot">\[\begin{equation}
\partial_t\,\theta(t) = \frac{F\, D_0}{m D(t)^2}\ t\ . \tag{31.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Equation <a href="mechanics.html#eq:theta-dot">(31.3)</a> does the motion accounting in terms of an angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span>. In contrast, Eq. <a href="mechanics.html#eq:y-dot">(31.2)</a> does the accounting in terms of a straight-line measurement <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span>. In Eq. <a href="mechanics.html#eq:y-dot">(31.2)</a> the multiplier on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the simple ratio of force to mass: <span class="math inline">\(F/m\)</span>. But in <a href="mechanics.html#eq:theta-dot">(31.3)</a> the ratio appears differently, with <span class="math inline">\(m\, D(t)^2\)</span> in place of plain mass and <span class="math inline">\(F D_0\)</span> in place of plain force.
The term <span class="math inline">\(m\, D(t)^2\)</span> is called the <strong><em>moment of inertia</em></strong> of the probe with respect to the planet. The term <span class="math inline">\(F\ D_0\)</span> is the <strong><em>torque</em></strong> of the force with respect to the distance: the force times the distance from the planet measured perpendicularly to the force.</p>
<p>The natural reason to use an angle for accounting is when you are working with rotational motion, such as understanding what happens when a kid jumps on or off a merry-go-round. Rather than using the ratio of force to mass, the angular acceleration <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{tt} \theta(t)\)</span> will equal the ratio of <strong><em>torque</em></strong> to <strong><em>moment of inertia</em></strong></p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-10" class="example"><strong>Example 31.3  </strong></span>Compute the moment of inertia of <code>Zcalc::Blob1</code>.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to say, “compute the moment of inertia.” We also have to specify what is the reference location. We’ll first do the calculation around the center of mass <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\)</span> which we computed earlier as <code>xbar</code> and <code>ybar</code>:</p>
