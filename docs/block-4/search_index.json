[["block4-intro-draft.html", "Introduction", " Introduction In Blocks 1 through 3, you learned how to formulate calculus questions in terms of functions and the two main operations of calculus, differentiation and anti-differentiation, which transform one function into another. You also learned the primary use of anti-differentiation, to accumulate the output of a function over an interval of the input variable. There is more mathematics yet to come. In Block 5 you’ll meet a major technique for modeling used in essentially all quantitative disciplines and with particularly important applications to data science. In Block 6 we’ll start to work with multi-component systems as they evolve in time. Here, in Block 4, we’re going to step momentarily away from the introduction of new mathematical concepts. Functions, differentiation, and anti-differentiation are impressive and useful in their own right so now we’re going to look at how they are used, how they manifest themselves in diverse ways in the world of science and technology. Our emphasis will not be on field-specific applications, although there are many! Instead, we’ll explore ways the concepts of calculus appear and are used broadly in quantitative work. "],["operations.html", "Chapter 27 Operations on functions 27.1 Task: Solve 27.2 Task: Argmax 27.3 Task: Iterate 27.4 Software for the tasks 27.5 Algorithmic techniques 27.6 Exercises", " Chapter 27 Operations on functions In Block 1, we introduced the idea of mathematical modeling, creating a representation of some aspect of the world out of mathematical “stuff.” As you know, for us the relevant “stuff” includes the concept of a function with its inputs and output, units and dimensions of quantities, frameworks such as the basic modeling functions and ways of combining functions via linear combination, composition, and multiplication. When we construct functions, the symbol \\(\\equiv\\) is appropriately used to mean “is defined to be.” We have used the tradition equal sign (\\(=\\)) but always to mean “is” or “amounts to” or “happens to equal.” For instance, we write \\(\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1\\) not as a definition of the sinusoid but to identify the output corresponding to a single specific input. In high-school algebra, much more emphasis was placed on equations. For instance, you might well see an equation like \\[{\\mathbf{\\text{equation:}}}\\ \\ \\ x^2 - 6 x - 3 = 0\\] in a beginning algebra textbook. It pays to think a little about what such an equation means and what information it is intended to convey. In particular, how is it different from a function like \\[{\\mathbf{\\text{function:}}}\\ \\ \\ p(x) \\equiv x^2 - 6 x - 3 \\ .\\] A simple equation like \\(3 + 4 = 7\\) is a statement of fact: three plus four is indeed exactly the same as seven. But \\(x^2 - 6 x - 3 = 0\\) is not a fact. The equality might be true or false, depending on what \\(x\\) happens to be. In an algebra course, is really meant to be an instruction to a person: \\[x^2 - 6 x - 3 = 0, \\ \\ {\\mathbf{\\text{Instruction}}}\\text{: Find x.}\\] What’s meant by “find \\(x\\)” is to determine which numerical values (if any) when substituted for \\(x\\) in the equation will produce a true statement. This is also called solving for \\(\\mathbf x\\). Algebra courses offer a variety of solving techniques that are effective for different types of problem statements. “Solving for \\(x\\)” is an example of a mathematical task. We undertake such tasks in order to extract useful information from a mathematical object. For instance, in high-school textbook “word problems,” you translate a verbal description of a situation—typically involving canoes paddling across a flowing river—into a matching mathematical form and then, having constructed the mathematical form, you apply some mathematical task to the form in order to reveal the answer you seek. In this chapter, we’re going to look at the mathematical tasks that are commonly performed on functions, that is, operations on functions. We’ll introduce you to algorithms that enable you to construct the task result without having to apply much mental work or engage puzzle-solving skills. Importantly, we’ll give a name to each task. That way, confronted with a mathematical problem, you will be able to look down the short menu of common tasks to decide which one is applicable to your circumstance. Even better, once the task has a name, you can tell a computer to do it for you. Here are some common mathematical tasks that you’ve already learned about: Given a function and specific values for the inputs, apply the function to the inputs to produce an output. Another name for this is to evaluate a function on inputs. Given a function and the name of a with-respect-to input, construct a new function that is the derivative of the given function. The name for this task is to differentiate the function. Like (2), given a function and the name of a with respect to input, anti-differentiate the function. Given a function and an interval of the domain of that function, accumulate the function on that interval. This is named to integrate the function on the interval. (You may recognize that you can perform this task by breaking it down into task (3) and then applying task (1) to the result. That is, \\(\\int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)\\).) In this chapter, we focus on the following operations on functions that you may not yet have mastered. Given a function and an output value from the function, find values for an input (or inputs) which will generate that output value. This is the solving task. A closely related task is zero-finding, which is to find an input that will cause the function to produce the output zero. Given a function and an interval of the domain, find an input value that will produce an output value that’s higher than would be produced for nearby inputs. As you might recognize, this is called finding an argmax. The problem of finding an argmin is exactly the same kind of problem, and can be solved by finding the argmax of the negative of the function. Given a function and an input value, iterate the function to produce a new input that will be better than the original for some purpose. These seven tasks allow you to perform a huge variety of the important mathematical work of extracting useful information from a model. Human judgement and creativity is needed to construct the model. And judgement and experience is needed to figure out which tasks to perform and in what order. But carrying out the tasks does not require judgement, experience, or creativity. Performing the tasks requires only an algorithm and the tools to step through the algorithm. Computers are excellent for this; you just have to give them the function and whatever additional input is required (e.g. the name of a with-respect-to-variable), and then tell the computer which task it is to perform. 27.1 Task: Solve Starting materials: a function \\(f(x)\\), ii, a known output value \\(v\\), and a candidate for a suitable input value \\(\\color{brown}{x_0}\\) Ideal result from the algorithm: A new candidate \\(\\color{magenta}{x^\\star}\\) such that \\(f(\\color{magenta}{x^\\star}) = v\\) or, equivalently, that \\[\\left|\\strut f(\\color{magenta}{x^\\star}) - v \\right| = 0\\ .\\] Realistic result from the algorithm: The new candidate \\(\\color{magenta}{x^\\star}\\) will be better than \\(x_0\\), that is, \\[ \\left|\\strut f(\\color{magenta}{x^\\star}) - v\\right|\\ \\ {\\mathbf &lt;}\\ \\ \\left|\\strut f(\\color{brown}{x_0}) - v\\right|\\] Easy case: When \\(f(x)\\) is a straight-line function, that is \\(f(x) \\equiv \\line(x) = a x + b\\), the solution can be found by simple arithmetic: \\[a x^\\star + b - v = 0 \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\ x^\\star = \\frac{b-v}{a}\\] Approximation strategy: If \\(f(x)\\) is not a straight-line function, construct the tangent-line approximation to \\(f()\\) that’s value near \\(x_0\\). This approximation function, which we’ll call \\(\\widehat{f}(x)\\) can be written in terms of \\(f(x_0)\\) and \\(\\partial_x f(x_0)\\) in the same way we’ve been doing since Block 2. \\[\\widehat{f}(x) \\equiv f(x_0) + \\partial_x f(x_0) \\left[\\strut x - x_0 \\right]\\ .\\] Because \\(\\widehat{f}(x)\\) is a straight-line function, it’s easy to find an input that will generate exactly the desired output value \\(v\\), that is, a value for \\(x\\) such that \\(\\widehat{f}(x) = v\\). This is a matter of solving algebraically for \\(x\\) in the equation \\[f(x_0) + \\partial_x f(x_0) \\left[\\strut x - x_0 \\right] = v\\ ,\\] We use \\(x_1\\) to denote that exact solution to the approximate problem: \\[\\begin{equation} x_1 = x_0 + \\frac{v-f(x_0)}{\\partial_x f(x_0)} \\tag{27.1} \\end{equation}\\] Although \\(x_1\\) is an exact solution to the approximate problem, all we can hope is that it will be an approximate solution to the actual problem, which may involve a nonlinear function \\(f(x)\\). In particular, we want \\(x_1\\) to be a better guess than \\(x_0\\): \\[\\|f(x_1) - v\\| \\underbrace{&lt;\\,}_\\text{We hope!} \\|f(x_0) - v\\|\\] This (hopefully) improved solution \\(x_1\\) can become the starting guess for a new round of improvement \\[\\begin{equation} x_2 = x_1 + \\frac{v-f(x_1)}{\\partial_x f(x_1)} \\tag{27.2} \\end{equation}\\] Equations (27.1) and (27.2) involve evaluating a function, which we might call better(), at the current guess: \\(x_0\\) to start and then \\(x_1\\). \\[\\text{better}(z) \\equiv z + \\frac{v-f(z)}{\\partial_x f(z)}\\ .\\] The form of better() is called a Newton step. The idea is to start with an initial guess \\(x_0\\) and then take successive steps to get closer and closer (hopefully!) to the actual answer \\(x^\\star\\): \\[x_1 = \\text{better}(x_0)\\\\ x_2 = \\text{better}(x_1)\\\\ x_3 = \\text{better}(x_2)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_i = \\text{better}(x_{i-1})\\\\\\ \\\\ \\text{until eventually}\\ \\|f(x_i) - v\\|\\ \\text{is practically zero.}\\] Figure 27.1: A Newton-step calculation seen graphically. The brown function is approximated as a straight-line function at the initial point \\(x_0\\). The resulting \\(x_1\\) is where that straight line crosses the value \\(v\\) on the output scale. Here, \\(x_1\\) is a little to the left of the actual place where \\(f()\\) crosses \\(v\\). The Newton step produced an improved guess, since \\(\\|x_1 - x^\\star\\|\\) is smaller than \\(\\| x_0 - x^\\star\\|\\). Example 27.1 Construct the Newton-step function for the function \\[f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x\\] to find \\(x^\\star\\) such that \\(f(x^\\star) = 4\\). Since \\(\\partial_x f(x) = 2 x - 1\\), the Newton-step function will be: \\[\\text{better}(z) = z - \\frac{z^2 - z - 4}{2 z - 1}\\] We’ll pick \\(x_0 = 2\\) as a starting guess: \\[\\text{better}(x_0 = 2) = 2.66666 \\longrightarrow x_1 : f(x_1) = 4.444444\\\\ \\text{better}(x_1 = 2.66666) = 2.56410 \\longrightarrow x_2 : f(x_2) = 4.010419\\\\ \\text{better}(x_2 = 2.56410) = 2.56155 \\longrightarrow x_3 : f(x_3) = 4.000001\\] The output \\(f(x_3)\\) is practically the desired \\(v=4\\): We have our answer: \\(x^\\star = 2.56155\\)! Just the first Newton step, producing \\(x_1 = 2.666666\\) did not completely solve the problem. You can think of the problem like the task of digging a well. You need to start with the first shovelful. Then take another and another and … until you have your well. Newton’s method involves creating a custom better() function for each new problem. But we can create the functions automatically: make_better_fun &lt;- function(tilde, v) { f &lt;- makeFun(tilde) df &lt;- D(tilde) better &lt;- function(z) {z + (v-f(z))/df(z)} return(better) } Let’s test it out: f &lt;- makeFun(x^2 - x ~ x) better &lt;- make_better_fun(f(x) ~ x, v=4) # Take three steps starting at x0=3 xstar &lt;- 3 %&gt;% better() %&gt;% better() %&gt;% better() f(xstar) ## [1] 4 The process we’ve presented here is not guaranteed to work. By exploring cases where it fails, computational mathematicians1 have developed strategies for increasing the range of situations for which it works. The R/mosaic function Zeros() incorporates several good practices, including attempting to make a good guess for \\(x_0\\) automatically. To use Zeros(), you construct a function \\(g(x) \\equiv f(x) - v\\), and Zeros() will produce a good \\(x^\\star\\) or, even better, a set of them. Zeros() returns a data frame with two colums. The first gives input values that correspond to an output near zero. The second column, named .output. calculates the output (and will be near zero). Illustrating with a previous example: g &lt;- makeFun(x^3 - 6 ~ x) xstar &lt;- Zeros(g(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(1,6))) xstar       1.8171 , xstar       2e-04 How well did this work? with(xstar, g(x)) # should be zero       2e-04 27.2 Task: Argmax The task of finding the input value that corresponds to a local maximum is called argmax finding. We don’t need to know the value of the local maximum to solve this problem. Instead, we designate a locale by specifying an initial guess \\(x_0\\) for the argmax. For argmax finding of an objective function \\(f(x)\\), we seek a \\(x^\\star\\) such that \\(f(x^\\star) &gt; f(x_0)\\). To accomplish this, we’ll approximate \\(f(x)\\) with a low-order polynomial, as we so often do. We’ll call the approximation \\(\\widehat{f(x)}\\). In the solving task, the approximation was with a first-order polynomial. But first-order polynomials—that is, straight-line functions—don’t have a local argmax. We need to use a second-order polynomial. Easy enough: construct the second-order Taylor polynomial around \\(x_0\\): \\[\\widehat{f(x)} \\equiv f(x_0) + f&#39;(x_0) \\left[x - x_0\\right] + \\frac{1}{2} f&#39;&#39;(x_0) \\left[x-x_0\\right]^2\\] Remember that \\(f(x_0)\\), \\(f&#39;(x_0)\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x_0)\\) are all fixed quantities; they don’t depend on \\(x\\). To find the argmax of \\(\\widehat{f(x)}\\), differentiate it with respect to \\(x\\) and find the zero of the derivative: \\[\\partial_x \\widehat{f(x)} = f&#39;(x_0) \\underbrace{\\partial_x\\left[x - x_0\\right]}_{{\\large\\strut}1} + \\frac{1}{2} f&#39;&#39;(x_0) \\underbrace{\\partial_x\\left[x-x_0\\right]^2}_{2 \\left[x - x_0\\right]} = 0 \\] Giving \\[f&#39;(x_0) + f&#39;&#39;(x_0) \\left[x - x_0\\right] = 0\\ .\\] As with all solving-task problems, we seek \\(x=x^\\star\\) that will make the above statement true. This is \\[x^\\star = x_0 - \\frac{f&#39;(x_0)}{f&#39;&#39;(x_0)}\\ .\\] In other words, our new guess \\(x^\\star\\) will be a step away from the old guess \\(x_0\\), with the step being \\(-f&#39;(x_0) / f&#39;&#39;(x_0)\\). Use the R/mosaic argM() function to find argmaxes and argmins. Like other R/mosaic calculus functions, the first argument is a tilde expression defining the objective function. The second argument is the domain to search. To illustrate, the following code creates a randomly shaped function (displayed in Figure 27.2) and calls argM() to generate the argmaxes and argmins. f &lt;- rfun(~ x, 3215) Xstar &lt;- argM(f(x) ~ x, domain(x = -5:5)) Xstar x .output. concavity 1.028013 -26.52652 1 -2.950761 3.79984 -1 slice_plot(f(x) ~ x, domain(x=-5:5)) %&gt;% gf_point(.output. ~ x, data = Xstar, color=&quot;magenta&quot;, size=4, alpha=0.5) Figure 27.2: Illustrating the use of simple_argM() to find argmaxes and argmins. Notice that simple_argM() identified both a local maximum and a local minimum, that is, one argmax and one argmin. Visually, it’s easy to tell which one is which. In terms of the data frame returned by simple_argM(), the sign of the concavity does the identification for you: positive concavity points to an argmin, negative concavity to an argmax. The name argM(), of course, refers to this versatility of finding both argmins and argmaxes. 27.3 Task: Iterate In everyday language, to iterate means simply to repeat: to do something over and over again. In mathematics and in computing, “iterate” has a more specific meaning: to repeatedly perform an operation, each time taking the output from the previous round as the input to the current round. For our purposes, it suffices to define iteration in terms of the use of a function \\(g(x)\\). The function must be such that the output of the function can be used as an input to the function; the output must be the same kind of thing as the input. The iteration starts with a specific value for the input. We’ll call this value \\(x_0\\). Iteration then means simply to compose the function with itself starting with \\(x_0\\) as the initial input. Here, for instance, is a four-step iteration: \\[g(g(g(g(x_0))))\\] Or, you might choose to iterate for ten steps: \\[g(g(g(g(g(g(g(g(g(g(x_0))))))))))\\] However many iteration steps you take, the output from the final step is what you work with. Iteration is useful when you have constructed \\(g()\\) to correspond to a mathematical task you need to perform, especially the solve-task or the argmax-task. \\(g()\\) should be made so that the output is a better answer than the input. To illustrate, consider the solve-task, when we are trying to find an input value to a given function that will produce an output of some desired level, which we’ll call \\(v\\). Earlier, we developed the idea of a Newton step for solving a function \\(f()\\): \\[g(x) \\equiv \\underbrace{x}_{\\text{starting value}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{v - f(x)}{f&#39;(x)}}_{\\text{Newton step}}\\] The output of \\(g()\\) is designed to be better than the input. The idea here is to use the derivative of \\(f()\\) in order to tweak an initial guess for the solution to be a little better. A Newton step is actually a rather aggressive proposal for improving the starting value. Like many forms of aggression, it can sometimes get you exactly the opposite of what you sought. So in practice, it may be better to take only part of a Newton step. Here is a function that creates another function that gives the Newton step for a specified \\(f()\\) and \\(v\\): NewtonStepFun &lt;- function(tilde, v) { f &lt;- makeFun(tilde) fprime &lt;- D(tilde) # create a new function that calculates the Newton step for # this f() and this v, at a specified input x. function(x) { (v - f(x))/fprime(x) } } To illustrate, let’s make an example function \\(f(x)\\equiv \\left[x^2 - 3x\\right] \\left[1.3 + \\pnorm(x)\\right]\\) (Figure @ref(fig:nstep-example1}). Figure 27.3: An example function \\(f(x)\\) which we seek to solve for an output of 5. We seek to solve \\(f()\\) for an output of 5, that is, we are looking for an input \\(x^\\star\\) where \\(f(x^\\star) = 5\\). You can see the two solutions in Figure 27.3: for an input near \\(x=-1\\) the output is close to 5, as it is for an input of \\(x=3.5\\). Supposed you were given an initial guess \\(x_0 = -2\\). You can see from the graph that a step of about length 1 to the right will bring you close to where the output of the function will be 5. Likewise, for an initial guess of \\(x_0 = 4\\), you would want to take a step to the left of length about 0.5. That’s what a Newton step is supposed to do, bring you closer to the correct answer. Let’s construct a function that gives us the Newton step for any starting point \\(x\\), and test it out step_for_f &lt;- NewtonStepFun(f(x) ~ x, v = 5) step_for_f(-2) # should be about + 1       0.9436 step_for_f(4) # should be about - 0.5       -0.3652 This is a good match to the two crossings of \\(v=5\\) in Figure 27.3 Now that we have an expression for the step, we package it up into the function \\(g()\\) to be used for the iteration and then iterate \\(g()\\) from a starting guess. g &lt;- function(x) x + step_for_f(x) g(-2)       -1.0564 g(g(-2))       -0.8702 g(g(g(-2)))       -0.8661 g(g(g(g(-2))))       -0.8661 g(g(g(g(g(-2)))))       -0.8661 The first iteration brought us from the \\(x_0 = -2\\) starting point a little closer to the solution. A double iteration brought us further to the right. the successive iterations show little or now change from the output to the input, a good sign that we’ve done enough work and can declare ourselves done. Of course, you always want to make sure that the answer gotten, \\(x^\\star = -0.8661\\) is right. For this, we compute \\(f(x^\\star)\\), f(-0.8661108) # should be 5       5 Other than the exercises in this chapter, you will not have much need in this course to build your own functions for iterative improvement. But it is the mathematical technology behind the operators that perform the solving-task and the argmax-task. 27.4 Software for the tasks Evaluation of a function—number one in the list at the head of this chapter—is so central to the use of computer languages generally that every language provides a direct means for doing so. In R, as you know, the evaluation syntax involves following the name of the functions by a pair of parentheses, placing in those parenthesis the values for the various arguments to the function. Example: log(5) The other six operations on functions listed above, there is one (or sometimes more) specific R/mosaic functions. Every one of them takes, as a first argument, a tilde expression describing the function on which the operation is to be formed; on the left side is a formula for the function (which can be in terms of other, previously defined functions), on the right side is the with-respect-to variable. Differentiate D(). Returns a function. Anti-differentiate antiD(). Returns a function. Integrate: Integrate(). Returns a number. Solve Zeros(). Returns a data frame with one row for each solution found. Argmax argM() Finds one argmax and one argmin in the domain. local_argM() looks for all the local argmaxes and argmins. Returns a data frame with one row for each argmax or argmin found. Iterate Iterate(). Returns a data frame with the value of the initial input and the output after each iteration. Each of operations 4-6 involves the specification of a domain. For Integrate(), this is, naturally, the domain of integration: the upper and lower bounds of the integral For Zeros() and argM() the domain specifies where to search for the answer. Iterate() is slightly different. After the tilde expression comes an initial value \\(x_0\\) and then n= which you use to set the number of times to iterate. Another two R/mosaic functions that you frequently use generate graphics. slice_plot() contour_plot() These always take two main arguments: a tilde expression describing the function to be graphed and a plotting domain. Finally, there is one function for plotting variables from data frames: gf_point(). Again, the first argument is a tilde expression specifying two of the data frame’s variables: the variable on the left side will be assigned to the vertical axis, the variable on the right side to the horizontal axis. 27.5 Algorithmic techniques The key steps in optimization are setting up the objective function(s) and setting constraints as needed to represent the problem at hand. There are many ways to perform the work to extract the argmax once the objective function and constraints are set. Understandably, calculus textbooks tend to emphasize techniques based on finding an input where the derivative of the objective function is zero. For problems involving multiple inputs, the task is to find an input where the gradient vector is zero. Contemporary work often involves problems with tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of inputs. Even in such large problems, the mechanics of finding the corresponding gradient vector are straightforward. Searching through a high-dimensional space, however, is not generally a task that can be accomplished using calculus tools. Instead, starting in the 1940s, great creativity has been applied to develop algorithms with names like linear programming, quadratic programming, dynamic programming, etc. many of which are based on ideas from linear algebra such as the qr.solve() algorithm for solving the target problem, or ideas from statistics and statistical physics that incorporate randomness as an essential component. An entire field, operations research, focuses on setting up and solving such problems. Building appropriate algorithms requires deep understanding of several areas of mathematics. But using the methods is mainly a matter of knowing how to set up the problem and communicate the objective function, constraints, etc. to a computer. Purely as an example, let’s examine the operation of an early algorithmic optimization method: Nelder-Mead, dating from the mid-1960s. (There are better, faster methods now, but they are harder to understand.) Nelder-Mead is designed to search for maxima of objective functions with \\(n\\) inputs. The video shows an example with \\(n=2\\) in the domain of a contour plot of the objective function. Of course, you can simply scan the contour plot by eye to find the maxima and minima. The point here is to demonstrate the Nelder-Mead algorithm. Start by selecting \\(n+1\\) points on the domain that are not colinear. When \\(n=2\\), the \\(2+1\\) points are the vertices of a triangle. The set of points defines a simplex, which you can think of as a region of the domain that can be fenced off by connecting the vertices. Evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the simplex. One of the vertices will have the lowest score for the output of the objective. From that vertex, project a line through the midpoint of the fence segment defined by the other \\(n\\) vertices. In the video, this is drawn using dashes. Then try a handful of points along that line, indicated by the colored dots in the video. One of these will have a higher score for the objective function than the vertex used to define the line. Replace that vertex with the new, higher-scoring point. Now you have another simplex and can repeat the process. The actual algorithm has additional rules to handle special cases, but the gist of the algorithm is simple. 27.6 Exercises Exercise XX.XX: THpUtP Create a function, which iterated sufficiently from a starting guess, will implement Newton’s method to calculate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\).

(The situation is illustrated in Figure 27.4.) The length of the Newton step is proportional to \\(1/f&#39;(x_0)\\), which is large when \\(f&#39;(x_0) \\approx 0\\). Such a Newton step can produce \\(x^\\star\\) further from the actual solution rather than closer to it. Figure 27.4: An unlucky choice (magenta) of \\(x_0\\) near a local maximum has resulted in a Newton step that is too long. The Newton step creates \\(x_1 \\approx -3\\), far to the left of the actual zero crossing which is near \\(x\\approx 0\\). I. Take a second Newton step, that is, a step starting at \\(x_1\\) and ending at \\(x_2\\). You can eyeball the linear function that approximates \\(f(x)\\) near \\(x_1\\). What is the approximate value of \\(x_2\\). Try a simple modification to Newton’s method that can help deal with such situations. In the figure above, the full Newton step puts \\(x_1\\) where the dotted line crosses the brown line. This full step has length \\(\\| x_1 - x_0 \\|\\), in this case roughly 4.5. In your modification, instead of taking the full Newton step, take a step from \\(x_0\\) that is only half as long. That half step will bring you to a new \\(x_1\\).

We started the course by introducing a small set of basic modeling functions that generations of experience has shown to be good models in a wide variety of circumstances. We introduced methods to derive new functions from the basic modeling ones: linear combinations, inversion, differentiation, integration. We have often employed ow-order polynomial functions for expressing general modeling ideas such as growth, interaction, and optimality. As early as Chapter 3 of this book, we noted that a function can be described as a table where each row stands for one set of input values together with a corresponding output value. We did not, however, make much use of the table-as-function concept. Instead, we used data tables to motivate the choice of parameters, generally in linear combinations of the basic modeling functions. We called this function fitting, an important topic we will again encounter in Block 5 when we introduce new tools for treating functions as geometrical objects. This chapter introduces yet another important method for constructing functions that match with data. What’s different here from function fitting is that we do not consider the data as a “cloud” of points that we want our eventual function to stay close to. Today, each data point will be a mandate; the function is required to go through each and every point exactly. 28.1 Generating smooth motion As a motivating example, consider the programming of robotic arms as in the video: This isn’t a robots course, so we’ll simplify. The arm has a resting position. When a car frame comes into place, the arm moves so that it’s welding electrodes are at a specific, known place in space near the car body. Then it moves in sequence to other places where a weld is required, perhaps passing through waypoints to avoid obstacles. The problem of converting the discrete list of weld and waypoints into a continuous signal for the actuator is an instance of a mathematical process called interpolation. In real robot arms, there are multiple joints that need to be controlled simultaneously. For our illustration, we’ll use a simple setup where the robot hand rolls along a set of rails in the y-direction and another x-rail running crosswise to the y direction. The task for our example robot will be to visit the points shown in Figure 28.1 in order, taking 15 seconds to traverse the whole path. Figure 28.1: The stations on a path the robot hand is supposed to follow. All the action is taking place in roughly 1x1 meter area. Figure 28.1 shows a continuous path in \\((x,y)\\) coordinates together with discrete labels indicating when each waypoint is to be reached. Note that the path is not a function \\(y(x)\\). Mathematical functions are required to be single valued, meaning that for each value of the input (in the function domain) there can be only one, unique output value. The path in Figure 28.1 often involves two or more different \\(y\\) values for a single \\(x\\) value. There is even a small domain of \\(x\\) near \\(x=900\\) where the path at any given \\(x\\) crosses six different \\(y\\)-values. Even so, functions can be a useful way of describing the \\((x,y)\\) path. The key is the plural: functions. For the path in Figure 28.1 we need two quantities varying with time in a coordinated way. On approach, familiar to navigators, is to specify direction of movement and velocity at each instant of time. Perhaps not as familiar, but more fundamental mathematically, is to specify \\(x\\) as a function of time and, separately, \\(y\\) as a function of time. Using this formalism, the trajectory of the robot arm will consist of two functions, \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\). To build those functions, well start with the waypoints along the path represented in table form: head(Zcalc::Robot.stations) ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## t x y ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 496 191 ## 2 2 1037 138 ## 3 3 1251 191 ## 4 4 1226 411 ## 5 5 902 736 ## 6 6 1034 868 The \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) functions in this table aren’t complete enough to operate the robot. We need to provide the \\(x,y\\)-location data in the form of a continuous two functions of \\(t\\) so that the robot, at any time \\(t\\), can look up where it is supposed to be. One strategy is to construct the functions as piecewise linear functions of \\(t\\), like this: Figure 28.2: Two functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) which describe the path shown in Figure 28.1. It can be difficult to see the relationship between the \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) functions and the path shown in 28.1. As an exercise, look specifically at the segment \\(9 \\leq t \\leq 10\\). In Figure 28.2, this is the segment connecting points 9 and 10. In the path view, you can see that on this segment \\(x\\) changes a lot while \\(y\\) changes only a little. Correspondingly, in the function view (Figure 28.2) \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) is large in magnitude compared to \\(\\partial_t y(t)\\). The function shown in 28.2 is an example of an interpolating function. You’re entitled to think of the \\(x(t)\\) function as connecting with lines the sequence of \\(x\\) versus \\(t\\) coordinates from the table. Each of the two functions is clearly continuous. But, based on your work in Blocks 1 through 3, you have a richer set of concepts for interpreting those two functions. For instance, let’s look at \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\). Since \\(x\\) is a position along the cross rail, \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) is the velocity in that direction. Figure 28.3 shows the velocity versus time for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components of the movement. Figure 28.3: Velocity versus time time along the path defined by \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) as shown in Figure 28.2, The speed of the robot arm maxes out at about 600 mm-per-second. You can get a sense for this by moving your finger two feet in 1 second: a normal human speed of movement. Since the original \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) functions are piecewise linear, it makes sense that the derivatives with respect to time are piecewise constant. But the robot hand is a physical thing; it has to have a velocity at every instant in time. It can’t instantaneously have an undefined velocity. Think about what it is that causes the change from one velocity step to another. There’s a motor that’s spinning and changing it’s rate of spin, perhaps using a pulley and a belt to more the robot hand to the right position at any instant of time. Changing the velocity requires a force to create an acceleration. We can differentiate the velocity to see what the acceleration must be to create the simple piecewise linear function shown in Figure 28.2. Mathematically, the second derivatives \\(\\partial_{tt} x(t)\\) and \\(\\partial_{tt} y(t)\\) do not exist, because \\(\\partial_{t} x(t)\\) and \\(\\partial_{t} y(t)\\) are discontinuous. There is no physical amount of force that will change the velocity in an instant. As an accommodation to the physical existence of the robot hand, we’ve softened the transition between consecutive velocity segments to allow it to take 0.2 seconds, ramping up from zero force 0.1 second before the hand reaches the station, to maximum force at the station, then back down to zero 0.1 second after the hand reaches the station. Consequently the actual motion is smoother and the maximum acceleration is about half that of gravity. Figure 28.4 shows the resulting trajectory which can be likened to that of a baseball player rounding a base. Figure 28.4: A smoothed x-trajectory near station 2. The position of the station is marked with a dot. A consequence of smoothing the trajectory is that the robot hand comes near, but doesn’t actually touch the station. It misses by about 2 mm. For many human tasks that might be good enough, but for precision manufacturing a miss by 2 mm is about 1000 times more than allowed. If you like working with practical problems, you might find a simple solution to the problem. For instance, we could have aimed the robot hand 2 mm further to the right than the actual station. In falling short by 2mm, the hand would miss the new target but cross right over the originally intended station. Solutions like this ae sometimes called ad hoc, meaning that they are so specifically tailored to one situation that they do not generalize well to slightly different problems. The next section introduces an approach that is much more general. 28.2 Piecewise but smooth The approach we will take to smoothly connect the points on the path is based on ideas of derivatives and on the construction of low-order polynomials. In Block 2, we emphasized low-order polynomials up to the square term, and we’ll pick that up again here for demonstration purposes. For this example, we’ll construct only the \\(x(t)\\) function. Constructing \\(y(t)\\) would be done using exactly the same procedure. Our task is to find a function \\(x(t)\\) to interpolate discrete points such as those shown in Figure 28.5. The discrete points are called knots2 in the language of interpolating functions. Each knot is a coordinate pair \\((t_i, x(t_i))\\) shown as an orange dot in Figure 28.5. The piecewise linear interpolating function is easily constructed and is shown as a dotted curve. As we saw in the previous section, such a function has a discontinuous first derivative. We would like something smoother, with a continuous first derivative. A curve such as the one we seek is shown as the multi-colored function. Figure 28.5: Two piecewise interpolating functions of the four discrete points (orange). One is piecewise linear (dotted curve), the other is piecewise quadratic (multi-color curve). The framework we will adopt for the smooth interpolating function is piecewise quadratic segments between adjacent knots. There are four knots, requiring three segments. We’ll call the segment \\(p_1(x)\\) connecting the first knot to the second, with \\(p_2(x)\\) connecting the second to the third knot and \\(p_3(x)\\) connecting the third to the fourth knot. Each of those segments will be a second-order polynomial. To keep things organized, we’ll use coefficient names systematically: \\[p_1(t) \\equiv a_1 + b_1 \\left[t - t_1\\right] + c_1 \\left[t - t_1\\right]^2\\\\ p_2(t) \\equiv a_2 + b_2 \\left[t - t_1\\right] + c_2 \\left[t - t_1\\right]^2\\\\ p_3(t) \\equiv a_3 + b_3 \\left[t - t_1\\right] + c_3 \\left[t - t_1\\right]^2\\\\\\] The four knots are \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\left(t_1, x_1\\right)\\\\ \\left(t_2, x_2\\right)\\\\ \\left(t_3, x_3\\right)\\\\ \\left(t_4, x_4\\right)\\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\] which you can think of as two columns of a data frame, one with the \\(t\\)-coordinates of the knots and the other with the \\(x\\)-coordinates. For the knots in Figure 28.5 the data table is t x 1 0.0 2 2.0 3 0.5 4 1.7 Constructing the interpolating function is a matter of making good choices for \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), \\(b_3\\), \\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), and \\(c_3\\). We require these things of each of the interpolating polynomials: It passes exactly through the two knots marking the segment’s endpoints. That is \\(p_1(t_1) = x_1\\) and \\(p_1(t_2) = x_2 = p_2(t_2)\\) and \\(p_2(t_3) = x_3 = p_3(t_3)\\) and, finally, p_3(t_4) = x_4$. Note that at the interior knots where two polynomials join, the left-hand polynomial and the right-hand polynomial should exactly match the function value and each other. The derivative (with respect to \\(t\\)) should match where the segments join. That is, \\(\\partial_t p_1(t_1) = \\partial_t p_2(t_2)\\) and \\(\\partial_t p_2(t_3) = \\partial_t p_3(t_3)\\). Thus, the function we want to build will be \\(C^1\\), that is, have a continuous first derivative. How to accomplish (1) and (2)? Notice first that because we wrote each of the polynomials in the style of Taylor polynomials, we can read the values of \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_3\\) directly from the data table: \\[p_1(t_1) = a_1 = x_1\\\\p_2(t_2) = a_2 = x_2\\\\p_3(t_3) = a_3 = x_3\\\\\\] We can find other coefficients by imposing the conditions that the right side of each segment pass through the knot on that side. This gives: \\[p_1(t_2) = x_2 = a_1 + b_1 \\left[t_2-t_1\\right] + c_1\\left[t_2-t_1\\right]^2\\\\ p_2(t_c) = x_3 = a_2 + b_2 \\left[t_3-t_2\\right] + c_2\\left[t_3-t_2\\right]^2\\\\ p_3(t_c) = x_4 = a_3 + b_3 \\left[t_4-t_3\\right] + c_3\\left[t_4-t_3\\right]^2\\] (Notice that \\(t_2 - t_1\\) and the like are simply numbers that can be computed from the known knot points.) Another two conditions are that the derivatives of the polynomials from either side of each interior knot point must match at the knot point. Finding the derivatives of the segments is a simple exercise: \\[\\partial_t p_1(t) = b_1 + 2 c_1 \\left[t - t_1\\right]\\\\ \\partial_t p_1(t) = b_2 + 2 c_2 \\left[t - t_2\\right]\\\\ \\partial_t p_1(t) = b_3 + 2 c_3 \\left[t - t_3\\right]\\] Matching these derivatives at the \\(t_2\\) and \\(t_3\\) knot points—the interior knots where two segments come together—gives two more equations: \\[ \\partial_t p_1(t_2) = b_1 + 2 c_1 \\left[t_2 - t_1\\right] = b_2 = \\partial_t p_2(t_2)\\\\ \\partial_t p_2(t_3) = b_2 + 2 c_2 \\left[t_3 - t_2\\right] = b_3 = \\partial_t p_3(t_3) \\] All together, we have five equations in six unknowns: \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) and \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\). Plugging in the specific values \\(t_1\\) through \\(t_4\\), and \\(x_1\\) through \\(x_4\\) from the data table translates the equations for the polynomial values and derivatives gives this system of equations: \\[ b_1 + c_1 = x_2 - x_1 = \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 2\\\\ b_2 + c_2 = x_3 - x_2 = -1.5\\\\ b_3 + c_3 = x_4 - x_3= \\ \\ 1.2\\\\ b_1 + 2 c_1 - b_2 = 0\\\\ b_2 + 2 c_2 - b_3 = 0\\] This is not the place to go into the details of solving the five equations to find the six unknowns. (Block 5 introduces the mathematics of such things, which turns out to the came math used to find model parameters to “fit” data.) But there are some simple things to say about the task. First, you may recall being told in high-school mathematics that to find six unknowns you need six equations. We have only five equations to work with. But it is far from true that there is no solution for six unknowns with five equations. There are in fact an infinite number of solutions. (Again, Block 5 will show the mathematics behind this statement.) Essentially, all we need to do is make up a sixth equation to identify a particular one of the infinite number of solutions. It’s nice if this made-up equation reflects something interpretable about the curve. We’ll choose to have the sixth equation specify what the derivative of the interpolating function should be at the far right end of the graph. That right-most derivative value will be \\[\\partial_x p_3(x_4) = b_3 + 2 c_3 \\left[x_4 - x_3\\right]\\ .\\] We can set this value to anything we like. For instance, in Figure 28.5 the right-most derivative is set to zero; you can see this from the curve being flat at the right-most knot point. Figure 28.6: Four different \\(C^1\\) piecewise quadratic functions that interpolate the knot points. The functions have different values of the derivative at the right end of the domain. Keeping in mind the piecewise nature of the interpolating polynomial, it may seem surprising that changing the slope at \\(t_4\\) leads to a change in value of the function almost everywhere. Yet the stiffness of the parabolic segments means that conditions in one segment have an impact on adjacent segments. In turn, the segments adjacent to these also change, a change that percolates down to every segment in turn. Quadratic spline functions can be created with the R/mosaic qspliner() function. The second argument is a data frame giving the knot locations. The first argument is a tilde expression specifying the variables to use from the data frame. xfun &lt;- qspliner(x ~ t, data = Zcalc::Robot.stations) yfun &lt;- qspliner(y ~ t, data = Zcalc::Robot.stations) Quadratic splines are rarely used in practice. (A cubic spline provides helpful flexibility. See Section 28.3.) In Figure 28.7 you can see one of the reasons: the quadratic form is so stiff that the interpolating function tends to shift from concave up to concave down (or vice versa) at each knot point. This results in the interpolating function tending to have a local minimum or maximum between adjacent knots, even if the data themselves to not indicate such a structure. Figure 28.7: A quadratic spline interpolation of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the robot-path knots. The data hardly speak for themselves, since the interpolationg function tends to alternate between concave up and concave down in adjacent segments between the knots. Putting together the \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) interpolating functions, each of which has that extremum between knot points, leads to an absurdly complicated path, as seen in Figure 28.8. Figure 28.8: Connecting the robot-path knots with a piecewise quadratic polynomial, constructed to be \\(C^1\\). The path is pretty perhaps, but absurd. 28.3 C2 smooth functions In the previous section, we arranged the function \\(x(t)\\) composed from the piecewise quadratic segments to be \\(C^1\\) smooth. (Recall that \\(C^1\\) smooth means that the derivativ e\\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) continuous.) We established this continuity by make sure that each segment has a value of the derivative at its end-point know that matches the derivative of the adjacent segment. Could we also arrange the coefficients of the quadratic segments to be smooth at the \\(C^2\\) level? \\(C^2\\) means that the second derivative \\(partial_{tt} x(t)\\) is continuous. It’s easy enough to calculate the second derivative of the segments: \\[\\partial_{tt} p_1(t) = 2 c_1\\\\ \\partial_{tt} p_2(t) = 2 c_2\\\\ \\partial_{tt} p_3(t) = 2 c_3\\] To make the second derivatives match at the knots requires \\(c_1 = c_2 = c_3\\), but this contradicts the value- and derivative-matching equations developed in the previous segment. So we cannot guarantee that the piecewise quadratic segments be \\(C^2\\) continuous. To arrange \\(C^2\\) continuity requires that the segment include a new parameter. Most commonly, this is done by moving from quadratic segments to cubic segments. This can be done by an approach similar to that of the previous section but somewhat more elaborate. Such a \\(C^2\\) interpolating function is called a cubic spline. Cubic splines are very commonly encountered in applications requiring interpolation. With the ability to match piecewise cubic polynomials to a set of knots, we can easily construct the smooth path to connect the knots in 28.1. Figure ?? shows a \\(C^2\\) path connecting the knots. The path is constructed by plotting simultaneously the output of two functions, \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\), with the input \\(t\\) on the domain \\(1 \\leq t \\leq 16\\). Cubic spline functions can be created with the R/mosaic spliner() function. The second argument is a data frame giving the knot locations. The first argument is a tilde expression specifying the variables to use from the data frame. xfun &lt;- spliner(x ~ t, data = Zcalc::Robot.stations) yfun &lt;- spliner(y ~ t, data = Zcalc::Robot.stations) Figure 28.9: A cubic spline interpolation of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the robot-path knots. The cubic spline respects the monotonicity of consecutive knot points. Figure 28.10: Connecting the robot-path knots with a piecewise cubic polynomial, constructed to be \\(C^2\\). 28.4 Bézier splines The sort of interpolating functions described in the previous two sections were designed to be smooth at the \\(C^1\\) level (quadratic spline) or the \\(C^2\\) level (cubic spline). Such smoothness makes sense for, say, robotic motion where we want to keep the force on each robot joint small at all times. Not all path-related design problems require such smoothness. Indeed, in some settings, non-smoothness is called for. For instance, Figure 28.11 shows the outline of a familiar shape Figure 28.11: The outline of a letter in a computer font is often specified by a series of knot points (red dots). The path passes smoothly through some of the knot points, but has a discontinuous derivative at others. For both quadratic and the more commonly used cubic splines, matching the derivatives on either side of a knot is essential to constructing the function. For Bézier splines, each segment is mathematically independent from every other segment. It is up to the human designer of the curve to determine whether the curves derivative should be continuous or discontinuous at a knot point connecting two segments. The shape of a Bézier spline segment is established by four independent points. The first and last points determine the endpoints of the segment. Each endpoint is associated with a control point that sets the angle and “speed” with which the path leaves or enters the endpoint. You can interact with the graph in Figure 28.12 to develop an intuition. Figure 28.12: A single Bézier segment is defined by two endpoints and two control points. Drag the control points to see how the shape of the curve is defined by them. The curve for a given segment is gratifyingly smooth. The real power of Bézier splines stems from how segments can be connected in various ways. Figure 28.13 shows two Bézier segments that have been initialized to have a smooth junction at endpoints 4 and 5. The smoothness is set by the corresponding control points (marked 3 and 6). So long as those four points (3, 4, 5, 6) are colinear and in order, the junction will be smooth. You can alter control points 2 and 7 in any way you like; the junction will remain smooth. Figure 28.13: Two Bézier segments can be arranged in to create a smooth or non-smooth junction between them. Consider the path followed by a Bézier curve as it leaves one of the endpoints. Figure 28.13 has been initialized so that the tangent to the curve is horizontal at the right endpoint and almost vertical at the left endpoint. The further the control point is from the endpoint, the longer the Bézier curve will stay close to the tangent line. Another way to think of this is that the position of a control point has little impact on the shape of the curve near the opposite endpoint. You can observe this on the canvas by, say, moving control point 2 and observing the relatively little change near endpoint 4. Figure 28.14: A Bézier curve leaves each endpoint in a direction that is tangent to the line drawn between the endpoint and its control point. Algebraically, each Bézier segement is a pair of cubic functions, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate. Both of those functions take as an input another quantity, which we’ll call \\(t\\), that varies between 0 and 1. The coordinate pair \\(\\left({\\large\\strut} x(0), y(0)\\right)\\) is one endpoint of the curve, while \\(\\left({\\large\\strut} x(1), y(1)\\right)\\). Each intermediate value of \\(t\\) corresponds to a point on the interior of the curve. The \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) functions have the same form, the difference between the functions being only the values of the end values (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_4\\) for the \\(x(t)\\) function, and similarly \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_4\\) for the \\(y(t)\\) function), as well as the control-point values (\\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) for one function, \\(y_2\\) and \\(y_3\\) for the other.) \\[x(t) = (1-t)^3\\, x_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\\, x_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\\, x_3 + t^3\\, x_4\\\\\\text{and}\\\\ y(t) = (1-t)^3\\, y_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\\, y_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\\, y_3 + t^3\\, y_4\\] Before the advent of digital design and manufacturing, smooth curves were described by clay or wooden models hand-crafted by skilled workers. Material was removed to conform to the models by machine tools directed by cams running over the models, by hand sanding and polishing, as shown in this video of propeller manufacture during World War II. Spline functions and digital actuators have largely replaced such analog models. 28.5 Exercises Code-reading Exercise XX.XX: DP2hxD These questions are just about R/mosaic code reading skills.

Your task in this problem is to construct a few such paths connecting points 10 and 11 in Figure 28.1. To start, draw a pair of coordinate axes: one for \\(x\\) versus \\(t\\) and the other for \\(y\\) versus \\(t\\). For both, arrange the domain for \\(t\\) to be \\(10 \\leq t \\leq 11\\). The range of the vertical axis for the \\(x\\) versus \\(t\\) frame should cover the \\(x\\)-component of the path from point 10 to 11, and similarly for the range of the vertical axis for \\(y\\). Task A On your axes, sketch the graphs of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) that will construct a constant-velocity path starting from point 10 at \\(t=10\\) and reaching point 11 at \\(t=11\\). (The term “constant-velocity” has a specific technical meaning. Recall that the \\(x\\)-component of velocity will be \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) and similarly for the \\(y\\)-component.) Task B On the same coordinate axes, graph new functions \\(x_2(t)\\) and \\(y_2(t)\\) arranged such that at time \\(t=10.1\\), a position halfway between points 10 and 11 has been reached; at time \\(10.2\\) a position half of the remaining distance to point 11 is reached; at time \\(10.3\\) a point half of the remaining distance to 11 is reached; and so on until point 11 is reached at \\(t=11\\). Task C Again on the same coordinate axes (or new ones, if your graphs have become too crowded), graph new functions \\(x_3(t)\\) and \\(y_3(t)\\) such that the position along the path varies smoothly from point 10 at time \\(t=10\\) to point 11 at time \\(t=11\\), but the motion briefly comes to a halt halfway along the path, then starts up again. (Note that “smoothly” has a technical meaning.) Exercise XX.XX: MQ1rZa Referring to the quadratic spline interpolating functions in Figure 28.6, note that the different functions all go through the knots.

Exercise XX.XX: ZGG7SO Consider a set of \\(n\\) knot points \\((t_i, x_i)\\) and imagine that you have two different spline functions, \\(s_a(t)\\) and \\(s_b(t)\\), each of which passes through every one of the knot points. Under what conditions, if any, can a linear combination of \\(s_a(t)\\) and \\(s_b(t)\\) also be a spline function that passes through each of the knot points? Exercise XX.XX: Vru4NQ The drawing canvas has been populated with three Bézier segments. Connect and shape them to reproduce the shape of the airfoil shown below. Note that the airfoil surface smoothly rounds the leading edge but has a sharp junction at the trailing edge. Note also that the top and bottom surfaces are not symmetric. Your task is to reproduce the airfoil shape using Bézier segments. On your homework paper, sketch the shape you created, indicating clearly where the control points are for each segment. If you were able to reproduce the airfoil shape using 1 or 2 Bézier segments your answer to (i) will suffice. If you need 3 segments, briefly explain what aspects of the airfoil shape required three segments. Exercise XX.XX: N6z7nD In a Bézier spline, \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) can be interpreted as the \\((x,y)\\) coordinate at time \\(t\\) of a pen on the drawing canvas. Let’s take that interpretation literally and figure out some features of the pen’s motion. it’s reasonable to think about the pen in physical terms. The \\(x\\)-component of the pen as a function of time \\(t\\) is \\[x(t) = (1-t)^3\\, x_1 + 3(1-t)^2 t\\, x_2 + 3(1-t) t^2\\, x_3 + t^3\\, x_4\\] where the domain is \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\). In terms of the coefficients \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\), and \\(x_4\\) …. Where will the pen be at time \\(t=0\\)? Where will the pen be at time \\(t=1\\)? Consider the velocity \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) of the pen. (We’re thinking of the \\(x\\)- direction only. The pen will also have a \\(y\\)-component of velocity.) What is the velocity of the pen at \\(t=0\\), that is, what is \\(\\partial_t x(t=0)\\)? You should be able to give an algebraic form for this. Imagine that the pen moved with constant initial velocity \\(\\partial_t x(t=0)\\). (It doesn’t, but imagine that it does.) At what value of \\(t\\), if any, will the pen reach the \\(x\\)-value \\(x_2\\)? Find the velocity of the pen at \\(t=1\\). Again, as in (a), you should be able to give an algebraic form for this. Imagine the pen moving backwards in time from \\(x(1) = x_4\\) at the velocity \\(\\partial_t x(t=1)\\). At what time \\(t &lt; 1\\), if any, would the pen have been at value \\(x_3\\)? GIVE VELOCITY, … Called such possibly because the curves are tied together at each of the knots.↩︎ "],["opimization-and-constraint.html", "Chapter 29 Opimization and constraint 29.1 Gradient descent 29.2 Objectives and Constraints 29.3 Constraint cost 29.4 Exercises", " Chapter 29 Opimization and constraint In Chapter 23 we introduced some basic concepts and terms relating to optimization: the objective function, that is, the quantity that is to be made as large as possible (maximization) or as small as possible (minimization), depending on context; argmin and argmax values, that is, the value of the inputs to the objective function that produce the optimal output; and the max and min, the output value of the objective function when the input is an argmax or argmin respectively. A simple optimization problem has three main phases: a modeling phase in which the objective function is identified or constructed; a solution phase where argmin or argmax inputs are found. an evaluation phase where the objective function is applied to the argmin and/or argmax, and the result interpreted in terms of the real-world task at hand. To illustrate, we’ll draw on a chestnut found in hundreds of calculus texts, finding the configuration to construct the rectangular box with the largest possible volume out of a piece of cardboard. The modeling phase starts with a representation of the box-construction and volume-finding process. Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that we are working with a piece of cardboard fixed at 20 inches by 30 inches. For box construction, we’ll propose cutting out squares from each corner of the box of some side length \\(x\\). Those squares will be discarded and the box formed by folding up the flaps generated by the squares’ removal, as in Figure 29.1. Figure 29.1: Cardboard for forming the simple box. For the volume of the box, we’ll multiply the area of the bottom of the box by the height \\(x\\). Examination of Figure 29.1 should be enough to convince you that the volume \\(V\\) is a function of \\(x\\): \\[V(x) = x\\cdot (20-2x)\\cdot(30-2x) = x(600 - 100 x + 4 x^2)\\ .\\] Since the goal is to find the maximum possible volume, \\(V(x)\\) is our objective function. The solution phase can be adequately accomplished by drawing a graph of \\(V(x)\\) and finding the \\(x\\) corresponding to the peak value of \\(V(x)\\). We’ll leave this for you to do in a sandbox; you can figure out the relevant domain by noting that the corner squares cannot overlap. Another, more classical solution method is to examine \\(\\partial_x V(x)\\) and solve for \\(x^\\star\\) such that \\(\\partial_x V(x^\\star) = 0\\). Confirm for yourself that \\[\\partial_x V(x) = 600 - 200 x + 12 x^2\\ ,\\] This will be zero for \\(x^\\star\\) giving \\(600 - 200 x^\\star + 12 \\left[x^\\star\\right]^2 = 0\\), which equation will be satisfied, as you can confirm with the quadratic equation at two values: when \\(x_1^\\star = 3.92\\) or \\(x_2^\\star = 12.74\\). The evaluation phase can start with plugging in the objective function the values of \\(x^\\star\\). \\[V(x_1^\\star) = 1056.3\\ \\text{in}^3 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ V(x_2^\\star) = -315.6\\ \\text{in}^3\\] It’s common sense that \\(x_2^\\star\\) is not a viable solution. The negative volume at \\(x_2^\\star\\) is a consequence of looking at \\(V(x)\\) beyond the sensible domain for cardboard boxes. More generally, as part of the evaluation phase we can look at the value of the convexity \\(\\partial_{xx} V(x^\\star)\\) to find out whether an \\(x^\\star\\) value is an argmax or an argmin. Since \\(\\partial_{xx} V(x) = 24 x - 200\\) we see that \\(\\partial_{xx} V(x_1^\\star) &lt; 0\\), corresponding to an argmax, while \\(\\partial_{xx} V(x_2^\\star) &gt; 0\\) which corresponds to an argmin. Alternatively, instead of computing the convexity, we could check whether we have an argmin or an argmax by evaluating the objective function at a nearby input. The evaluation phase ought also to produce an indication of how sensitive the output is to small changes of the input near the argmax (or argmin). For example, setting \\(x=4\\) in will produce a volume output \\(V(4) = 1056\\) in2, hardly different than the “exact” maximum of 1056.3 in3 and perhaps preferred for the person who wants to make standard-size boxes. The evaluation phase should also include a reflection on how well the model reflects the real-world situation. For example we’ve neglected the creases that arise from folding cardboard, so a more complete examination would estimate this effect. And the person skeptical about calculus-book chestnuts might wonder whether the object is really to create a box without a top! Optimization problems analogous to this example do sometimes come up in applied work. More commonly, however, optimization problems involve much more complicated objective functions with many inputs. The next section considers the basis for a more general and practical approach to the solving phase of optimization. Later sections examine how this more general approach leads to methods for approaching the sort of real-world optimization problem where there are multiple objectives. 29.1 Gradient descent The general approach we will take to the solving phase of optimization problems will be iterative as in Chapter 27. Start with an initial guess for an argmin and then construct a new function that can improve the guess. Applying this improvement function iteratively leads to better and better estimates of the true argmin. For illustration purposes, we’ll use optimization problems where the objective function has two inputs. Such objective functions can be graphed with, say, a contour plot and it’s possible to see the action of the iterative improvement process directly. The idea of iterative improvement also applies to optimization problems with many inputs even though the action can’t be seen graphically. Spring-mass systems: an example context As a context for for talking about optimization, we’ll consider how to use optimization to calculate the configuration of simple mechanical systems consisting of interconnected springs and masses. Such configuration problems are especially important today in understanding the structure and function of proteins, but we will stick to the simpler context of springs and masses. Figure 29.2 shows a mechanical system consisting of a mass suspended from a fixed mounting by three nonlinear springs. Figure 29.2: A mass suspended from two springs. The masses is shown by a black circles. Springs are the zig-zag shapes. The bold bar is the fixed mounting, as if from a beam on the ceiling of a room. The system has an equilibrium configuration where the springs are stressed sufficiently to balance each other left to right and to balance the gravitational force downward on the mass. We want to calculate the equilibrium position. The basic strategy is to model the potential energy of the system, which consists of i. the gravitational potential energy of the mass; ii. the energy stored in stretched or compressed springs. Since the configuration of the system is set by the coordinate \\((x_1, y_2)\\), the potential energy is a function \\(E(x_1, y_1)\\). For brevity, we’ll leave out the physics of the formulation of the potential-energy function; shown in Figure 29.3. Figure 29.3: The potential energy of the spring-mass system in Figure ??. The potential energy has a bowl-like shape. The bottom of the bowl—the argmin—is near \\((x=1.7, y-=1.3)\\). In terms of Figure 29.2, the equilibrium position is a bit upward and to the right of the position shown in the figure. With a graph of the objective function like Figure 29.3, the solution phase is simple. But for more complicated objective functions, with more than 2 inputs, the graph would not be feasible. For example, in the spring-mass system shown in Figure 29.4, the potential energy function has six inputs: \\(x_1, y_2, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3\\). In genuine applications of optimization, there are often many more inputs. Figure 29.4: A more complicated spring-mass system. In a multi-input optimization problem, we don’t have a picture of the whole objective function. Instead, we are able to evaluate the objective function for a single given input at a time. For instance, we have a computer function that implements the objective function and we’re free to evaluate it at whatever inputs we care to choose. It’s as if, instead of having the whole graph available, the graph is covered with an opaque sheet with a loophole, as in Figure 29.5. Figure 29.5: A more realistic view of what we can know about a function. We can see the function only in a small region of the domain and need to use the information provided there to determine which way to move to find the argmin. The situation is analogous to standing on the side of a smooth hill in a dense fog and finding your way to the bottom. The way forward is to figure out which direction is uphill, which you can do directly from your sense of balance and proprioception by orienting your stance in different ways. Then, if your goal is the top of the hill (argmax) start walking uphill. If you seek a low point (argmin), walk downhill. The mathematical equivalent to sensing which direction is uphill is to calculate the gradient of the objective function. In Chapter 24 we used partial differentiation with respect to each of the input quantities to assemble the gradient vector, denoted \\(\\nabla f() = \\left({\\large \\strut} \\partial_x f(), \\ \\partial_y f()\\right)\\). In terms of Figure 29.5, where we are standing at about \\((x_i=0.8, y_i=-2.3)\\), we would evaluate the each of the partial derivatives in the gradient vector at \\((0.8, -2.3)\\). The gradient points in the steepest direction uphill so, once you know the direction, take a step in that direction to head toward the argmax, or a step in the opposite direction if you seek the argmin. The process of following the gradient toward the top of the hill is called gradient ascent. Correspondingly, following the gradient downhill is gradient descent. Figure 29.6: The gradient provides information about the shape of the local function in a convenient form to guide the step to the next locale in your journey toward the argmin or argmax. For humans, the length of a step is fixed by the length of our legs and the size of our feet. The mathematical step has no fixed size. Often, the modeler gains some appreciation for what constitutes a small step from the modeling process. Referring to Figure 29.4 for example you can see that a small increment in \\(x\\) is, say, \\(0.1\\), and similarly for \\(y\\). There is little point in taking an infinitesimal step—that gets you almost nowhere! Instead, be bold and take a finite step. Then, at your new location, calculate the gradient vector again. If it’s practically the same as at your earlier position, you can wager on taking a larger step next time. If the new gradient direction is substantially different, you would be well advised to take smaller steps. Fortunately, a variety of effective ideas for determining step size have been implemented in software and packaged up as algorithms. The modeler need only provide the objective function in a suitable form and providing a starting position or domain for the search. The R/mosaic function argM() is set up to find argmins and argmaxes using the familiar tilde-formula/domain style of arguments used throughout this book. For instance, the potential energy of the spring-mass system shown in Figure 29.2 is available as Zcalc::SM_2_potential() argM(SM_2_potential(x, y) ~ x &amp; y, domain(x=0:3, y=-3:0)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## x y .output. ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1.65 -1.21 -3.55 Optimization using symbolic techniques is often found in textbooks as part of the derivation of textbook formulas. The symbolic techniques are especially appropriate because they allow parameters to be represented with symbols rather than as specific numbers. Usually the objective functions involved are simple. Numerical techniques are the most widely used in practice. Optimization is an important operation in both science and management and much human ingenuity has gone into the development of effective algorithms. The modeler rarely if ever needs to reach beyond the software provided in technical computing environments such as R, MATLAB, Mathematica, or the many packages available for Python. In data science and machine learning, increasingly software is provided as web services and APIs (application programming interfaces) such as TensorFlow for the particular machine technique called “deep learning.” In using such software systems, the modeler needs to understand the structure of the arguments handed off to the systems. It’s also important to be able to test whether you have structured those arguments appropriately to represent your intentions. This often involves some level of debugging and the incremental development of objective functions so that you can verify correct performance on a simple version of the objective function before adding more detail and repeating the cycle of verify-then-add-more-detail. As a simple example of support for such debugging, we’ll examine a basic R function, optim(), for carrying out optimization. You can see the documentation for optim() by giving the command ?optim in a sandbox. You’ll likely find it hard to follow at first and using such functions requires a deeper understanding of R programming than needed in this book. (The R/mosaic argM() function makes use of optim() internally, surrounding it with an interface using tilde expressions and domains.) To illustrate, Figure ?? traces the sequence of ascent steps followed by optim() in working toward the argmin of SM_2_potential(). Figure 29.7: The path followed by optim() in descending the gradient, starting at (0,0). Successive steps are numbered. Starting at the initial guess, \\((x_0, y_0) = (0,0)\\) the algorithm takes a step of length about 1.5 to the east-south-east. The gradient at point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is discernibly different than at \\((x_0, y_0)\\); the algorithm follows the new gradient vector but with a shorter step length. At \\((x_2, y_2)\\) there has been a more severe change in the gradient, so the angle takes an even shorter step to the point labeled 3. The bottom two graphs zoom in on the gradient field for later steps. The most dramatic changes in direction are at \\((x_6, y_6)\\) and \\((x_9, y_9)\\). As the gradient vector gets shorter, so do the step sizes, terminating when the step size is insignificant. Example 29.1 The potential energy function of the spring-mass system in Figure?? is available as the function Zcalc::SM_3_potential(). We can use argM() to to find the argmin: argM(SM_3_potential(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) ~ x1 &amp; y1 &amp; x2 &amp; y2 &amp; x3 &amp; y3, domain(x1 = 0:3, y1=-3:0, x2=0:3, y2=-3:0, x3=0:3, y3=-3:0)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 7 ## x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 .output. ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.796 -1.04 1.60 -1.56 2.40 -1.59 -2.04 Figure 29.8 shows the argmin translated into the graphical format. Figure 29.8: The equilibrium configuration of the spring-mass system from Figure ??. Admittedly, the tilde-expression/domain interface to argM() is becoming ungainly with six inputs. In professional work, a different programming format based on vectors is used. We won’t need that for our simple examples. 29.2 Objectives and Constraints Many real-world optimization problems do not fit neatly into the framework of constructing an objective function and then finding the argmin (or argmax). A common situation is having multiple objectives and, often, the original problem statement does not include all of the objectives. When such missing objectives become apparent, it’s necessary to visit the modeling phase of the problem to insert the new objective. By adopting the right approach to modeling, such situations can be readily handled and, even better, the modeling phase can bring new insight into the real-world problem. We’ll illustrate by returning to the mathematically simplified problem of constructing an optimal cardboard box. Before, we stipulated that the raw cardboard stock has dimension 20 inches by 30 inches. Now we’ll generalize, and work with a piece of cardboard that has edges of length \\(y\\) and from which, as before, we’ll cut out square corners of length \\(x\\) on a side. Our objective is to make a box with the largest possible volume. (This will be an argmax problem.) The area of the bottom of the box is \\((y - 2x)^2\\) and the box height is \\(x\\). The objective function is the volume of the box, area times height: \\[V(x, y) \\equiv x (y - 2x)^2\\ .\\] There are two inputs, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so a simple plot should suffice to find the argmax. Figure 29.9: The volume of the box (in cubic inches) constructed by cutting corners of size \\(x\\)-by\\(x\\) out of a \\(y\\)-by-\\(y\\) piece of cardboard. Scanning Figure 29.9 reveals a couple of things that you might not have anticipated. First, the argmax is in the extreme upper-left corner of the graphics frame, not in the center as in previous examples. Second, the argmax in this corner, \\((y=0, x=10)\\) is logically inconsistent with the idea of a cardboard box. The logical inconsistency stems from an inadmissible value for \\(x\\). For \\(2x &gt; y\\), the bottom of the box would have negative edge length. Multiplying the two negative edge lengths to calculate the area produces a positive area, but this is not a realistic calculation. To make the calculation realistic, we should look at the situation only in that region of the graphics frame where \\(y &gt; 2x\\). This restriction is called an inequality constraint. Figure 29.10: The inequality constraint that \\(y &gt; 2x\\) renders much of the graphics frame inadmissible as a possible solution. The inadmissible region is shaded in blue. The argmax must be sought in the unshaded region of the frame. With the \\((x,y)\\)-domain restricted to the values that are physically realistic, we can see that the argmax is still on the edge of the frame, at \\(y=30\\) and \\(x\\approx 5\\), where the volume of the box will be about 1800 in3. This result should cause you pause, since there was nothing in the problem statement that limited \\(y\\) to be 30\" or less. If we replotted with a larger domain for \\(y\\), we should see still larger boxes, without any limit. Essentially, the interpretation of the problem as originally posed is that, with enough cardboard we can make a box of any size! That’s not so useful. The fault in the problem statement is that it omitted another objective function: use as little cardboard as possible. But if that were our sole objective, we would make a zero-volume box out of zero-area of cardboard. What we want, somehow, is to make as big a box as possible out of as little cardboard as possible: we have two objectives! In this case, the objectives are in conflict: making a bigger box (good) uses more cardboard (bad). Common sense tells us to balance the two objectives, but how to represent this mathematically? Ideally, we would know how much box-volume is worth to us and how much cardboard costs, and we could construct an objective function that incorporates both value and cost. If you have the information to do this, then go ahead. For instance, if each cubic inch of volume is worth 1 cent, and each square inch of cardboard costs 3 cents, then the objective function will be the following (with output in cents): \\[\\text{Profit}(x,y) \\equiv 10\\, \\sqrt{x (y-2x)^2} - 0.3 y^2\\] Figure 29.11: The “profit” (value minus cost) of the cardboad box (cents). The Profit() function has an argmax at about \\(y=45, x=7.5\\). The value of the Profit() function at this argmax is a bit greater than 210 cents. One problem with constructing objective functions like Profit() is finding appropriate value and cost. Typically, it requires a market and the ability to buy and sell to set a value, but for a little company designing a box there’s unlikely to be such a mechanism. In a realistic modeling setting, the challenge is to convince the decision makers that the model function is right, something it can be hard to do without good evidence. But let’s imagine a new factor coming into play. At the meeting where the box-design decisions are being made and where you are presenting your analysis in Figure 29.11, the graphic designer speaks up. “The trending shape for this year is cubic. We want the box, whatever it’s size, to be a cube.” Luckily, you the modeler can quickly incorporate this into your analysis. To be a cube, the height \\(x\\) of the box has to be the same as the width and depth \\(y - 2x\\). So you can incorporate the designer’s wish into the model of the decision factors by adding a new constraint: \\[x = y - 2x \\ \\ \\ \\implies y-3x=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{constraint: box must be cubic}\\] This is called an equality constraint. Figure 29.12 shows the equality constraint in green: to be a cube, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be somewhere along the green line. Figure 29.12: An equality constraint calling for the box to be cube-shaped. There happens to be something remarkable about the be-a-cube constraint. It runs practically parallel to the 50 cent contour of the profit function. If you look carefully, you can see that the highest profit along the green constraint occurs about \\(y=25\\), but the differences in profit along the constraint are mainly trivial for \\(y &lt; 35\\) or thereabouts. This means that the profit function does not show a clear preference for one size box instead of another, pick any \\(y &lt; 35\\) and look up the corresponding \\(x\\) that falls on the green constraint. Many organizations use a budget mechanism to manage their affairs. The organization defines divisions or projects, and each of these is given a dollar budget to stay within. The individual division or project manager can arrange things more or less as she thinks best, so long as she stays within the budget. This is a kind of constraint: a budget constraint. Suppose you have been tasked to set up a new factory and given a budget of $5,500,000 to do so. You were given this task because you have a particular expertise in how best to set up the factory, but your design will of course depend on the relative prices of the different inputs to the production process. For simplicity, let’s imagine that there are two main inputs: labor \\(L\\) and capital/equipment \\(K\\). It would be silly to spend all the budget on labor and none on capital; the workers would have no tools to work with. Similarly, capital without labor has no productive value. The best design for the factory will be a mix of labor and capital. Since the purpose of the factory is to make things for sale, a good objective function will be the sales value of the output produced by the factory. Economists have a favored form for production functions of this sort, called a power-law called the Cobb-Douglas function. The essential insight behind the Cobb-Douglas function is that doubling both capital and labor (as if you built a second factory alongside the first) should double production. The Cobb-Douglas form for production as a function of capital and labor is \\[Q(L, K) = p b L^a K^{1-a}\\ .\\] You will use your expertise to set the values of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parameters. The price \\(p\\) of each unit of output will be set by the market: Let’s assume for planning purposes that it’s $450 per unit. Suppose you have determined that \\(a=0.3\\) and \\(b=40\\) are appropriate. Then the production function will be as shown in Figure 29.13. Figure 29.13: A Cobb-Douglas production function with \\(p=100\\), \\(b=40\\) and \\(a=0.3\\). (Output units in dollars). As you can see from Figure 29.13, the more labor and the more capital you use, the higher the production. Notice that the production function itself does not have an argmax interior to the domain being plotted. It’s one of those “more is better” situations. Suppose that labor, in person-months costs $6000 per unit. Capital, in units of production stations, costs $13,000 per unit. Your budget constraint reflects the total cost of capital and labor: \\(4000 \\cdot L + 15000 \\cdot K \\leq 5500000\\). This constraint is graphed in Figure 29.14. Figure 29.14: The production function with the budget constraint shown in green. Any mixture of labor and capital that falls outside the green zone stays within your budget. What’s the best mixture? The one that gives the largest production. You can read this off the graph, \\(L\\approx 650\\) and \\(K\\approx 125\\). Notice that near the argmax, the contours of the production function are parallel to the boundary of the constraint zone. A good way to think about this is to walk along the boundary of the constraint zone from top to bottom. As you start near \\(K=250\\) and \\(L=380\\), the path you walk goes uphill in terms of the production function. The path continues uphill until you reach the argmax. Near the argmax, the path is level. After the path crosses the argmax, it is leading downhill. Near the argmax, the production function contours are parallel to the constraint boundary because, as at argmaxes generally, the objective function is flat near the argmax. With the constraint boundary crossing the slope, the argmax means that the path is locally level even though it slopes up and down on either side of the path. 29.3 Constraint cost In the previous section, the graphic designer’s request that the box be cubic was translated into an equality constraint, \\(y-3x=0\\), shown as the green line in Figure 29.12. The skilled modeler can bring additional power to the analysis by translating that constraint, \\(y-3x=0\\) into a function, for example \\[\\text{Equation:}\\ \\ \\ y - 3x = 0\\ \\ \\longrightarrow\\ \\ \\ \\text{Function:}\\ \\ \\text{cube_box}(x, y) = -\\| y - 3x\\|\\ .\\] Any \\((x^+, y^+)\\) that produces \\(\\text{cube_box}(x^+, y^+) = 0\\) is a pair that satisfies the constraint. In other words, the equality constraint amounts to the zero contour of the cube_box() function. Translating the constraint into a function changes “the box must be a cube” into “better if the box is a cube.” Thus, cube_box() becomes an objective function that has an argmax when the box is a cube. Instead of having the single objective function Profit() and a constraint (“cube-shaped box”), we have two objective functions. The constraint-to-function translated situation is shown in Figure 29.15: Figure 29.15: The two objective functions, Profit() and cube_box(), that are to be optimized simultaneously. The cube_box() function is shown with green contours, with the heavy green line being the contour at cube_box(x,y)=0. The optimization problem now becomes finding a way to maximize both objectives simultaneously, that is, picking an \\((x^\\star, y^\\star)\\) that makes the value of both objectives as good as possible. Unfortunately, increasing the \\(Profit()\\) of the box can be achieved at the cost of decreasing the value of cube_box() function; the two objectives are in conflict. Admittedly, Figure 29.15 is graphically busy and hard to read. You can start by picking a point in the middle of the graphics frame and reading out, from the appropriate contours, the output value of the Profit() function and the output value of the cube_box() function. Earlier, we saw that if restricted to inputs on the contour cube_box(x,y) = 0, the optimal output value of Profit() is about 50 units. Now we have a broader picture. For instance, suppose we allow a “little” deviation in box shape from a cube, say, cube_box(x,y) = -5. If we allowed this, the value of the Profit() function could be increased from 50 to about 115 cents. Whether the 65 cent increase value justifies the deviation from a cube measured as \\(cube_box(x,y) = -5\\) is worthwhile is a matter of judgement. It’s obvious, of course that a loss of 5 is justified by a gain of 65, but remember that the 65 has units of cents whereas the -5 is in some kind of abstract “cube points.” We don’t have an immediate way to translate “cube points” into cents. The two different units are said to be incommensurate, meaning that they can’t be directly compared. Nonetheless, we now have a basis for a conversation. It might go like this: Modeler to Designer: I realize that from your perspective, a cube is the optimal shape for the box. Designer: Right. Cubes are in fashion this year. Last year it was the Golden Ratio. Modeler: It might sound surprising, but we find that so long as you are close to the optimal, it doesn’t much matter if you are exactly on it. How close to a perfect cube would be good enough? Designer: What’s really important is that the box be perceived as a cube in our sales material. I think that most customers would think “cube” so long as the edge lengths are within about 15% of one another. Modeler: That’s very helpful. Let me re-make the graphic showing the percent deviation from cubeness. Then we can see how much extra box Profit() we can get by allowing 10% deviation. Modeler: A 10% deviation lets us get to a higher Profit(): from 50 cents to 65 cents per box. Product manager: How about a 30% deviation? That let’s us get up to about 100 cents. Designer: But it would make the box shaped almost like a brick. Bricks are so 1990s! Modeler: It sounds like a 15% deviation would be about right. Posing the problem as the optimization of two objective functions, rather than an objective and a constraint, allows such conversations to be held. Let’s return to a previous example about determining optimal levels of labor and capital in a factory. In that example, the objective function was the money value of the product produced. There was also a budget constraint. In translating the budget constraint into a function, we can call the function expenditure(K, L), with the constraint amounting to saying that the expenditure must be at a certain level: expenditure(K, L) = $5,500,000 in the example. To see check whether it’s worthwhile to stick to the constraint, we can plot both the production function and the expenditure function together. Figure 29.16: The production function (magenta, curved lines) and the expenditure function (brown, straight lines). Contour labels are in millions of dollars. We’ve drawn contours at levels that happen to be tangent to the expenditure contours. With the production function and budget constraint, the optimum was exactly on the $5.5 M expenditure line; the argmax for production is just about where the label 7.1 is in Figure ??. That is, the maximum production consistent with the budget is $7.1 M. Translating the budget constraint into an expenditure function reveals some other possible choices. For instance, if the budget were expanded to $6.5 M, the production level would reach $8.4 M. That an increase in budget of $1 M produces an increase in production worth $1.3 M (that is, 8.4- 7.1) sounds like a good argument for increasing the budget. But higher management may have even better uses for that $1 M expenditure, perhaps in some other product line or in research and development. It’s helpful to present the increase in the objective function output that can be had by relaxing the budget constraint as a ratio. In this case, the ratio is 1.3/1.0. This ratio is often called the Lagrange multiplier. Some economists have a more evocative name for it, the shadow price of the constraint. Thus, the constraint-to-function translation provides a way to put a cost on the constraint, which can be a reasonable way to determine the value of something when there is no direct market for it. An important example of a shadow price comes in the setting of life-saving interventions. For example, increasing spending on highway safety can save lives. If $7.5 billion in increased expenditures saves 1000 lives, the shadow price is $7.5 M per life. People who mis-interpret the constraint-to-function methodology often think that it’s craven to put a money value on life. In reality, the method merely reveals the money value on life implicit in decisions such as budget allocations. Knowing that the shadow price is $7.5 M does not say what the value of life should be. But it provides a mechanism for comparing different uses for the money. For instance, if the shadow price for increased regulation of toxic industrial chemicals is $11.3 M per life, the relative shadow prices provide an indication that budget money might reasonably be shifted from chemical regulation to highway safety. Economists and epidemiologists who undertake such calculations reveal that the mixture of spending on different life-preserving interventions is far from optimal. ::: {.takenote data-latex=\"\"} Generations of calculus students have been taught a method of mathematical optimization in the presence of constraints that involves positing a Lagrange multiplier, typically written as \\(\\lambda\\), and carrying out a series of differentiations followed by equation solving to find an argmax, which simultaneously provides a numerical value for \\(\\lambda\\). It’s easier to understand the motivation behind this by considering the gradient of the objective function and the gradient of the constraint function. If the goal is, say, to maximize production and simultaneously minimize expenditures, we would want to walk up the production gradient and down the expenditure gradient. Figure 29.17 shows two gradient fields, one for the production function in the factory-design example and one for expenditure. (The negative of the expenditure gradient is shown, since the goal is to keep expenditures small.) Figure 29.17: The production and expenditure functions displayed as gradient fields. Expenditure is brown, production is magenta. At each point in the graphics frame, the two gradient vectors form an angle. For example, near the point labeled (a) the angle is roughly 140 degrees, while near (b) the angle is 180 degrees. Any value of \\(K\\) and \\(L\\) where the angle is less than 180 degrees is sub-optimal or dominated by some other choice of \\(K\\) and \\(L\\). For instance, near label (a), you could improve both production and expenditures by moving to the southeast. When the angle is 180 degrees, the objective and constraint functions are in complete opposition to one another; any movement in favor of one comes at the cost in the other. 29.4 Exercises Exercise XX.XX: QXWRP8 The figure shows a contour plot of an objective function \\(f(x,y)\\). There is a gradient field and a path plotted along with the contour plot. A. Does the gradient field in Plot 1 correspond to the contour plot of the objective function? Explain why or why not both in terms of the direction of the gradient vectors and their lengths. B. Does the path, which starts at the point marked “0” and heads toward the point marked “10,” follow the gradient field. Explain your answer. C. Is the path a gradient ascent, a gradient descent, or neither. D. In Plot 2, is the path a gradient ascent, a gradient descent, or neither. E. In Plot 2, is the path a gradient ascent, a gradient descent, or neither. Exercise XX.XX: rG11sg The plot shows an objective function (contours labeled in black) and a constraint function (in orange). What is the constrained argmax when the constraint level is at 600? (Bold orange line.) What is the value of the objective function at this argmax? What is the shadow price of an increase in the level of the constraint? Exercise XX.XX: LiJkK2 In this exercise, you will work with an optimization problem. First, we’ll ask about a mathematical solution to the problem. Next, we’ll show that the mathematical solution is not necessarily the best real-world solution, because of multiple objectives in decision making. Then we’ll show you a real-world decision-making rubric that’s widely accepted, at least among people who listen to the whole story with an open mind. The graph shows the estimated number of lives saved by three different health-care related interventions – A, B, C – as a function of the amount of money spent on each. You have $1,000,000,000 to spend altogether on these interventions. Your policy alternatives are all the different combinations of spending on (A), (B), and (C) that add up to $1B (or less). How should you split up the money among the interventions? For example, we could spend $125M on B, $125M on C, and $750M on A. This would save an estimated 346 lives. Can we do better? Imagine that we use \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) to denote expenditure, with \\(x\\) spent on intervention A, \\(y\\) on intervention B, and \\(z\\) on intervention C. Altogether, the budget is \\(x + y + z = \\$1B\\). Question A Suppose \\(x = 750\\), \\(y = 125\\), and \\(z=125\\), where units are millions of dollars. It’s suggested that reducing \\(x\\) by $1M in order to increase \\(z\\) by that amount will produce a better outcome in terms of the total number of lives saved. That is, move some money from intervention A to intervention C. Is this suggestion correct? Why or why not? Not correct. The number of lives saved by spending $750M on A is larger than the number that would be saved by spending that much on B or C.︎✘ We’re only talking about moving a small amount from A to C Not correct. We will want to move the money to B instead.︎✘ Be that as it may, the question was whether to move money from A to C. Correct. The derivative \\(\\partial_x A(x)\\) at \\(x=750\\) is smaller than the derivative \\(\\partial_z C(z)\\) at \\(z=125\\).Good. Reducing \\(x\\) by a small amount will reduce the output \\(A(x)\\), but since \\(\\partial_z C(z=125)\\) is greater, the loss in output due to a reduction in spending on A will be more than made up by an increase in output from spending more on C. Correct. We should spend equally on all three interventions. That is, set \\(x = y = z = 333.33....\\)︎✘ This is intuitively attractive, but still doesn’t address the question of whether the outcome would be improved by moving money from A to C. A general principle is this: If spending a little more on one intervention increases the output more than the loss due to spending less on another intervention, the shift in funding is worthwhile. Question B If you follow the above logic, you will continue to move money from A to C until it is no longer beneficial to do so. What will be the maximum amount of spending on A makes it not worthwhile to move additional money from A to C? (Choose the closest answer.)     $250M︎✘        $375M︎✘        \\(500M&lt;span class=&#39;mcanswer&#39;&gt;\\) $       $625M︎✘ Question C Imagine that you have moved all the money from A to C that it’s worthwhile to do . Which of these statements is true at those values \\(x_0\\), \\(z_0\\)? \\(\\partial_x A(x_0) = \\partial_z C(z_0)\\)Correct.  \\(A(x_0) = C(z_0)\\)︎✘ \\(C(x_0) = A(z_0)\\)︎✘ \\(\\partial_x A(x_0) = 0\\) and \\(\\partial_z C(z_0) = 0\\).︎✘ We found it worthwhile to move expenditure from A to C to optimize the sum of their outputs and are operating at about \\(x_0 = \\$500M\\) and \\(z_0 = \\$375M\\), leaving \\(y=\\$125M\\) to spend on intervention B. Is it worthwhile to move money from A or C to B or vice versa? But first, a simpler question. Question D If we were going to move a small amount of money from A or C into B, would it be better to take the money from A or from C? Why? Take it from A, since we’re spending far more on A than C.︎✘ Take it from C, since we’re already spending far less on C than on A.︎✘ Take it from C. The slope \\(\\partial_z C(z_0)\\) compared to \\(\\partial_x A(z_0)\\) is such that a small reduction on spending on C has less impact than a small reduction in spending on A.Nice!  Take it from A. The slope \\(\\partial_z C(z_0)\\) compared to \\(\\partial_x A(z_0)\\) is such that a small reduction on spending on A has less impact than a small reduction in spending on C.︎✘ Question E Right now in our process, we’re planning to spend $125M on B. Is it worthwhile to move money from C to B? No, the output of B larger than the output of C at $125M.︎✘ Yes, move most of the money from C to B.︎✘ Yes, but only move a little money from C to B.Correct.  No, move money from B to C.︎✘ Question F At the optimal amount of money \\(y^\\star\\) spent on B and \\(z^\\star\\) spent on C, which of these is true about the slopes \\(\\partial_y B(y^\\star)\\) and \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)? There’s not any fixed relationship. They are what they are.︎✘ The two slopes are equal.Excellent!  The slope of B is greater than the slope of C.︎✘ The slope of C is greater than the slope of B.︎✘ Question G Is it more proper to say the “slope \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)” rather than the “derivative \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)?” (This is a general review problem for the course, not something specifically about optimization.) Yes. A derivative is a function while a slope is a quantity.Excellent!  No. Slope and derivative are the same thing.︎✘ No, the derivative is a function. When you evaluate that function at a particular value of \\(z\\) (say, \\(z^\\star\\)) the output will be the slope of the original function at that value of \\(z\\). Yes. “Derivative” sounds fancier than “slope”.︎✘ It’s not a matter of fancy, it’s a matter of being precise. No. Slopes measure steepness from right to left, while derivatives give steepness from left to right.︎✘ Where did that come from. The convention for the sign of a slope is always the direction left to right. Background: The graphs are fictitious, but let’s pretend they are: A Surgical treatment of congenital heart defects in newborns. B Treatment for hemophilia. C Memory-care for people with Alzheimers. Notice that the people being affected are in different, non-overlapping groups. So moving funding from one group to another is effectively “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” If you, as a decision maker inherited a situation where \\(x = \\$750M\\), \\(y=\\$125M\\), and \\(z=\\$125M\\), changing the expenditures would make one group better off (no matter how you did it!) and would make another group worse off. And imagine the headlines if you moved money from A to C or B: “Government slashes funding for newborns!”. Or perhaps an editorial: “We need to find a way to increase funding for hemophilia without cutting other life-saving spending.” This raises an important question: Is it ever worthwhile to forgo spending to save lives? How would anyone decide which lives are worth saving? Most people are uncomfortable with such questions. Yet the decisions taken by leaders, whatever they be, inevitably have a mathematically equivalent formulation which translates to the value of life. Probably, most people would decline to make a decision comparing two lives, for instance, saving a 10-year old versus saving a 90-year old. But it is not always possible to escape such trade-offs and the people who need to take the decision need guidance about what to do. In an open society, we expect such decisions to be backed by good rationale and so we have to develop means for distinguishing between better and worse rationales. One example comes from epidemiology and the concept of a “quality-adjusted life year” (QALY). A QALY is a measure of duration of life adjusted for the health condition of the person — a year of a person in good health is 1 QALY, but a year in a person in very poor health is less than 1 QALY. QALYs do not solve the problem of optimizing health-related outcomes. They are an imperfect means of dealing with an impossible problem. Sometimes that is the best we can do. Exercise XX.XX: 2ZoCl8 Here is the gradient field of an objective function. 1. Where is the argmax?

The committee has two proposal before it and needs to decide how best to spend the available $50M budget: * **Proposal A**: Expansion of the pediatric organ transplant unit. * **Proposal B**: Creation of a new rehabilitation center for traumatic injury patients. Experts have evaluated each proposal in terms of different cost options and the impact that each will have on health outcomes. Following a standard epidemiological method, the impact is estimated in terms of &quot;Quality Adjusted Life-Years&quot; (QALY), a measure that combines the number of people affected, the number of years of prolonged life, and the improvement in quality of life for those treated. The expert estimates are available in the data frame `QALY_impact`: **QALY Impact of the Proposals** ```r QALY_impact ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## expend A B ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 0 0 ## 2 10 40 30 ## 3 20 100 80 ## 4 30 150 140 ## 5 40 170 160 ## 6 50 180 175 Such estimates from experts should be taken with a grain of salt, but they are often the best information you have to inform a model. You can turn the expert’s opinions into functions by using splines. In this case, there is good reason to think that output will increase monotonically with expenditure, so a monotonic spline is a good choice. The functions were created using these commands and are already available in your sandboxes: fA &lt;- spliner( A ~ expend, data=QALY_impact, monotonic=TRUE) fB &lt;- spliner( B ~ expend, data=QALY_impact, monotonic=TRUE) The problem is to find the best values for expenditures on Proposal A and B — call these expenditures \\(x_A\\) and \\(x_B\\) – given constraint that total expenditure is \\(x_A + x_B = 50\\). A simple approach is to plot out the total benefit as a function of expenditures on each of A and B: overall &lt;- makeFun( fA(xA) + fB(xB) ~ xA + xB) g_budget &lt;- makeFun(xA + xB ~ xA + xB) contour_plot(overall(xA, xB) ~ xA + xB, domain(xA=range(0,50), xB=range(0,50))) %&gt;% contour_plot(g_budget(xA, xB) ~ xA + xB, filled=FALSE, contours_at=NULL, contour_color=&quot;orange3&quot;, alpha=0.5) How can you confirm that the red contours in the plot genuinely represent the budget constraint at the indicated level? Question A What’s the largest number of QALYs that can be produced from combining the two proposals with a total budget of $50M?     120︎✘        160︎✘        180︎✘        240\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       300︎✘        340︎✘        350︎✘        360︎✘ Question B What is the location of the argmax in the previous graph? \\((A = 0, B = 50)\\)︎✘ \\((A = 6, B = 44)\\)︎✘ \\((A = 12, B = 38)\\)︎✘ \\((A = 22, B = 28)\\)Right!  \\((A = 34, B = 16)\\)︎✘ \\((A = 41, B = 9)\\)︎✘ \\((A = 50, B = 0)\\)︎✘ Another way to look at the problem is to find the total QALY outcome as a function of the amount \\(x_A\\), recognizing that once \\(x_A\\) is set, the remaining money will go to option B, so \\(x_B = 50-x_A\\). The following sandbox makes the plot. slice_plot( fA(xA) + fB(50-xA) ~xA, domain(xA = c(0,50))) Changing the Budget A broader social question is whether the budget is being set at an appropriate level. One way to examine this is to look at how the QALY outcome changes as the budget changes. For this, we’re going to find the set of non-dominated solutions, that is, all the values of \\(x_A\\) and \\(x_B\\) at which the derivatives \\(\\partial_{x_A} f_A()\\) and \\(\\partial_{x_B} f_B()\\) are equal. The following sandbox shows the difference between those two derivatives along with a bunch of different constraint paths. dfA = D(fA(xA)~xA) dfB = D(fB(xB)~xB) contour_plot( dfA(xA) - dfB(xB) ~ xA&amp;xB, domain(xA=range(0,50), xB=range(0,50)), contours_at = c(-2, -4, 0, 4, 2), skip=0) %&gt;% contour_plot(xA + xB ~ xA + xB, contour_color=&quot;orange3&quot;, skip=0) Yet another constraint! Question C The American Association of Allergy Activists (AAAA) has lobbied Congress to mandate that, of the 50 units of available funds, funding for A must be \\(x_A \\geq 40\\). How much would this constraint reduce the overall output for the two interventions combined? (Remember, if you’re spending, say, 45 on A, you can’t spend more than the remaining 5 on B.) The challenge for you in answering this question is to pick the appropriate one of the above graphs. Once you have done that, the answer is evident. No reduction at all.︎✘ About 10-20 QALYs.︎✘ About 40-60 QALYs.Correct.  About 100-120 QALYs.︎✘ It would actually increase the output.︎✘ Exercise XX.XX: VHn3UG Based on an extensive but fictive observation of activity and grades of college students, the model shown in the figure was constructed to give GPA as a function of the number of hours each weekday (Monday-Friday) spent studying and spent in social activity and play. (Activity during the weekend was not monitored.) Several points in the graphic frame have been marked with red letters. Refer to these letters when answering the following questions. Question A According to the model, what’s the optimal combination of Study and Play to achieve a high GPA?     F︎✘        G\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       H︎✘        I︎✘ Question B Which of these letters marks a place on the graph where the partial derivative of GPA with respect to Play is positive?     B︎✘        C︎✘        K\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       L︎✘ Question C Which if these ketters marks a place on the graph where the partial derivative of GPA with respect to Play is negative.     A\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       F︎✘        H︎✘        K︎✘ Question D Where is the partial derivative with respect to Study is negative?

Sleep is important, too, as are meals, personal care, etc. In the study, students were observed who spent up to 22 hours per day in Study or Play. Presumably, such students crashed on the weekend.

You’re hopeless. There aren’t enough hours in the day for you to get a good GPA.︎✘ You’ve got to squeeze out more effort studying. Give it your all!︎✘ Play more, study less!︎✘ Study less︎✘ Study less, play less. Sleep!Nice!  Exercise XX.XX: Yb6tVr We’d like to make a folded cardboard box in the most efficient way possible. As you know, cardboard boxes have four sides as well as eight flaps, four for the top and four for the bottom. The flaps are arranged to provide double coverage; you fold the flaps from one direction and then fold over them the flaps from the other direction. The diagram depicts the box sides and flaps laid out on a flat piece of cardboard. The flaps are shaded with diagonal lines. Suppose the height, width, and depth of the box are \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\) respectively. The box volume is easy: \\[V = h w d\\] The area of cardboard consists of the the four sides and the eight flaps. Each component’s area is a product of the two edge lengths. For example, the box sides are either \\(w h\\) or \\(d h\\). The flaps, each of which extends half-way across the bottom or top have areas \\(w d/2\\). Question A Which of these formulas gives the area of the cardboard making up the box? \\(2 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)Good.  \\(4 h(w + d) + 2 w d\\)︎✘ \\(2 h(w + d) + 8 w d\\)︎✘ \\(4 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)︎✘ A common size for a box is 1.3 cubic feet. We’ll use feet as the units for \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\). Question B The following formulas do not describe the area of the cardboard, but they are nonetheless formulas for something. Except one of them, which cannot be true. Which one? \\(h(w + d)/d + w d^2/h\\)︎✘ \\(h(w + d) + w h d\\)Right! This formula is not dimensionally consistent \\(h(w + d) + w^2 h/d\\)︎✘ \\(h(w^2/d + d) + d^2\\)︎✘ As \\(w\\), \\(h\\), or \\(d\\) are changed, the volume and surface area of the box are changed. Asking for the \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\) that minimize the surface area of the box is not a complete statement of a problem. The minimum surface area will be zero whenever two of the three dimensions have length zero. In other words, we can minimize the surface area by making a box that is no box at all! To complete the problem statement we need something else. Here, that something is a constraint: We demand that the box have a volume of \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet. Often, a constraint plays the role of a dimension reduction. With \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\), we have a 3-input optimization problem. But we can use the constraint equation to solve for one of the variables as a function of the other variables and the (known) volume. For instance, we can find \\(h\\) as \\[h = V/d w\\] Question C Plug in the above expression for \\(h\\) into the formula for the surface area of cardboard. Which of the following is the resulting formula in terms of \\(w\\), \\(d\\), and \\(V\\)? \\(2 V(w + d)/wd + 4 w d\\)Correct.  \\(V(w + d)/w + V(w+d)/d + 4 w d\\)︎✘ \\(2 w d (w + d)/V + 4 w d\\)︎✘ \\(2 (w + d)/wd + 4 V w d\\)︎✘ The following sandbox contains the formula for the surface area \\(A(w, d, V)\\) of a box of volume \\(V\\). The graphics command draw a contour plot of \\(A()\\) as a function of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), holding \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet. A &lt;- makeFun(2*V*(w+d)/(w*d) + 4*w*d ~ w + d, V = 1.3) dom &lt;- domain(w = c(0.5, 1.5), d=c(0.5, 1.5)) contour_plot(A(w, d) ~ w + d, dom, contours_at = NULL) %&gt;% gf_refine(coord_fixed()) # pipe to # gradient_plot( A(w, d) ~ w + d, dom) When you draw the contour plot, you’ll see a broad area near the center inside the contour at area = 9.5. Towards the upper-right and lower-left corners of the plot frame are contours at higher levels of area. Question D The spacing between the contours in the corners is tight, but there is no similarly spaced contour inside the region delimited by the contour at area=9.5. Why not? We didn’t ask for contours inside 9.5.︎✘ We didn’t ask, indeed. And we didn’t ask for any of the other contours specifically, yet they appear in the graph. The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the top of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.︎✘ Almost right! The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the bottom of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.Right!  All the points inside the 9.5 contour are at exactly the same height.︎✘ The function \\(C(w,d)\\) is infinitely differentiable so it’s not possible to make a sudden shift from a sloped form to one that is dead flat. Use the below sandbox and place contours at 10, 9.5, 9.4. You can do this by replacing the argument contours_at = NULL with this: contours_at = c(10, 9.5, 9.4)) Add more contours to build a fence tighter and tighter around the argmin. When the fenced region is tiny, you can read off the min from the contour label. (Remember, the “argmin” is the value of the inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) at which the function is minimized. The “min” is the value of the function at the argmin.) But watch out as you do this. If you ask for a contour at a level that’s lower than the min, it will simply not be drawn. Or, more precisely, there are no inputs that produce an output that’s lower than the min. So you may have to change the interval between levels (e.g. 10, 9.5, 9.4, …) in order to home in on the argmin. Question E The following are values for the output of the function where you might be able to draw a contour. Which one of the values is the smallest for which a contour actually appears?     9.1︎✘        9.05︎✘        9.01︎✘        9.005\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       9.0005︎✘        9︎✘ Question F From your contour plot, read off the values of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) that produce the minimum surface area for a 1.3 cubic-foot box. What are they? (Hint: You may need to zoom in on the domain to get the precision needed to answer the question.) \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)Nice!  \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.6\\)︎✘ \\(w \\approx 0.5; d\\approx 0.9\\)︎✘ \\(w \\approx 1.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)︎✘ It’s easy enough for a person to look at a contour plot and roughly locate the argmin. But this is not feasible if there are more than two inputs to the function being optimized. For such functions, another set of numerical techniques are used based on the gradient of the objective function. Remember that the gradient at any point is a vector that points in the uphill direction and whose length is proportional to the steepness of the slope. (Skiers, beware. In skiing what people call the gradient is the steepest downhill direction. This might account for all the mathematicians learning to ski who point their skis uphill in response to the ski instructor’s instruction!) You can display the gradient on the plot of the area function by piping (remember %&gt;%) the contour plot into the commented-out command in the sandbox. (Also, replace #pipe to with %&gt;%.) Question G Since the end of the term is coming, here’s a question that might be a good review for the final. Which of these describes the relationship between the gradient vector and the contours? On a contour the gradient vector is perpendicular (“orthogonal”) to the contour.Excellent!  On a contour, the gradient vector has zero length.︎✘ There is no definite relationship; it depends on the function itself.︎✘ On a contour, the gradient vector has a length proportional to the contour level.︎✘ Question H Which of these best describes the gradient vector at the argmin? The gradient points due North.︎✘ The length of the gradient vector is maximal.︎✘ The length of the gradient vector is minimal.︎✘ You can give a better description than this. The length of the gradient vector is zero.Nice!  Many numerical optimization techniques are based on the idea like this: treating the field of gradient vectors as a flow field in a differential equation. Starting at some initial value, follow the gradient vectors (as you did in sketching the trajectory in a flow field). If seeking a maximum, the flow will be in the direction of the gradient. If seeking a minimum, the flow will be opposite the direction of the gradient. It’s not necessary to calculate the gradient everywhere; you just have to calculate it at the present point on your trajectory to know which way to go next. Occasionally, particularly in textbook problems, the argmin or argmax is found algebraically. This still involves calculating the gradient as a function of the input variables. Then, find the inputs that make all the components of the gradient vector zero. Question I Which of these formulas give the gradient vector of \\(A(w, d)\\)? \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 w\\)Excellent!  \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2} - 4 w\\)︎✘ \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 d\\)︎✘ \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w} - 4 d\\)︎✘ Question J If the lengths \\(w\\), \\(d\\), \\(h\\) are measured in feet, what unit will \\(\\partial_w A\\) be in? feetExcellent! Right. The area will be in square feet so the derivative of area with respect to \\(w\\) will be in square feet per foot, that is, feet. square feet︎✘ cubic feet︎✘ 1/feet︎✘ dimensionless︎✘ For those of you who are pining for algebra problems, here you go. Taking the gradient of \\(A(w, d)\\) (given in a previous question), set both components to zero, giving you two equations in the two variables \\(w\\) and \\(d\\). There’s also a \\(V\\) in the equations, but we’ve set up the problem saying that we already know \\(V\\). Numerically, we used \\(V=1.3\\) cubic-feet, but in the algebra solution we can just leave \\(V\\) as a symbol, giving general formulas for \\(w\\) and for \\(d\\) in terms of \\(V\\). Question K Which of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(w^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)? (Hint: You can weed out one of the choices by checking for dimensional consistency.) \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\)Good.  \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{3}}\\)︎✘ \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[2]{V}}{\\sqrt[2]{3}}\\)︎✘ The solution for \\(d^\\star\\) is the same as for \\(w^\\star\\). (An experienced algebraist would have noticed that in the formula for area, you can swap inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) without changing the output.) Now compute the formula for the optimal value \\(h^\\star\\). (Hint: Early in the section we gave a formula that involves \\(V\\), \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\).) Question L Which of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(h^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)? \\(h^\\star = 2^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)Nice!  \\(h^\\star = 2^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)︎✘ \\(h^\\star = 3^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)︎✘ \\(h^\\star = 3^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)︎✘ It turns out that \\(h^\\star\\) is somewhat larger than either \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\); the optimal box has a square top and bottom, but the sides are not square. Question M Which of these is an appropriate explanation for why \\(h^\\star\\) is larger than \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\)? People don’t like using boxes that are perfect cubes.︎✘ Nice joke! But let’s get real now. The objective was to minimize the amount of cardboard, not to make people happy. \\(h\\) multiplies both \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), but not vice versa, in the formula for surface area.︎✘ Not true. There are terms \\(h w\\) and \\(h d\\) in the area formula. The flaps need to get longer as \\(h\\) gets longer, so smaller \\(h\\) helps to minimize the amount of cardboard.︎✘ The flap-length doesn’t depend on \\(h\\), only on \\(w d\\). So we can make \\(h\\) larger without contributing to the “wasted” area of the doubling over of flaps. The flaps get smaller as \\(wd\\) gets smaller, so larger \\(h\\) is preferred.Nice!  ::: "],["probability-and-evidence.html", "Chapter 30 Probability and evidence 30.1 Probability density 30.2 Three density functions 30.3 Mean and variance 30.4 Risk and data 30.5 Exercises", " Chapter 30 Probability and evidence This chapter is about the use of functions for the purpose of expressing what we do and do not know about uncertain situations. Such situations are common. For instance, a person may be at high risk for a disease, say, diabetes or lung cancer. The term “high risk” indicates that we know something about the situation: not whether or not the person has the disease but whether they are “likely” to have or to get it. Another example: a car might be said to be “unreliable.” We do not mean by this that the car cannot be used. Rather we’re thinking that from time to time the car might fail to start or run. A car where this happens once over a few year span is reliable, a car where this happens on a month-to-month basis is not reliable. You may well have had some textbook exposure to probability as an intellectual field. Typical examples used to illustrate concepts and methods are coins being flipped, dice being tossed, and spinners spun. Colored balls are drawn from urns, slips of paper from hats, and so on. Each of these is a physical representation of an idealized mechanism where we feel sure we understand how likely each possible outcome is to happen. In this chapter, we’ll use two basic imagined settings where uncertainty comes into play: the risk of disease before the disease is diagnosed and the safety of a self-driving car before it is in an accident. The word “imagined” signals that you should not draw conclusions about the facts of any particular disease or any particular self-driving car; we are merely using the imagined settings to lay out concepts and methods for the mathematical presentation and analysis of uncertainty and risk. Of particular importance will be the mathematical means by which we represent our knowledge or belief in these settings and the way we can properly update our knowledge/belief when new information becomes available. The calculus of probability and data introduces an additional convention for describing and naming functions. Throughout this book, the names have reflected the “shape” of the function—exponential, sinusoidal, sigmoidal, etc.—or the route by which the function was constructed, e.g. differentiation, anti-differentiation, inversion. Probability calculations often work out to be assembling an answer out of different kinds of component functions. An analogy is the assembly of an automobile out of different kinds of components: wheels, motors, body, and so on. You can’t put a wheel where the motor should go and produce a proper automobile. All motors play the same sort of role in the function of an automobile, but they can have different “shapes” such as gasoline, diesel, or electric. To understand how cars are built, you have to be able easily to distinguish between the different kinds of components. This is second nature to you because you have so much experience with automobiles. Likewise, to understand the probability calculations, you’ll have to master the distinctions between the roles functions play in a calculation. In this chapter you’ll see probability density functions as well as likelihood functions and prior functions and posterior functions and some others. As you get started, you will confuse these roles for functions with one another, just as a newborn child can confuse “wheel” with “motor” until experience is gained. Make sure to note the role-labels given to the functions you are about to encounter. 30.1 Probability density A probability, as you may know, is a dimensionless number between zero and one (inclusive). In this chapter, you’ll be dealing with functions relating to probabilities. The input to these functions will usually be a quantity that can have dimension, for instance, miles driven by a car. For some of the functions we will see in this chapter, the output will be a probability. For other functions in this chapter, the output will be a probability density. Probability relates to the abstract notion of an event. An event is a process that produces an outcome. For instance: Flipping a coin is an event where the possible outcomes of H and T. Taking a medical screening test is an event where the outcomes are “positive” or “negative.” Throwing a dart at a bullseye is an event where the outcome is the distance of the landing point from the center of the bullseye. An event with a discrete outcome—coin flip, medical screening test—can be modeled by assigning a probability number to each of the possible outcomes. To be a valid probability model, each of those assigned numbers should be greater than or equal to zero. In addition, the sum of the assigned numbers across all the possible outcomes should be 1. Events with a continuous outcome, such as the dart toss where the outcome—distance from the center—the probability model takes the form of a function whose domain is the possible outcomes. For the model to be a valid probability model, we require that the function output should never be less than zero. There’s another requirement as well: the integral of the function over the entire domain should be 1. For the dart-toss event, if we denote the distance from the bullseye as \\(r\\) and the assigned number for the probability model as \\(g(r)\\), the integral requirement amounts to \\[\\int_0^\\infty g(r) dr = 1\\ .\\] Note that the output \\(g(r)\\) is not a probability, it is a probability density. To see why, let’s use the fundamental theorem of calculus to break up the integral into three segments: \\(0 \\leq r \\leq a\\) and \\(a &lt; r \\leq b\\) and \\(b &lt; r\\). The total integral is \\[\\int_0^\\infty g(r) dr = 1\\ = \\int_0^a g(r) dr + \\int_a^b g(r) dr + \\int_b^\\infty g(r) dr.\\] The probability that the dart lands at a distance somewhere between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\[\\int_a^b g(r) dr\\ .\\] The dimension \\([r] =\\ \\)L and, suppose the units are centimeters. We need \\(\\int g(r) dr\\) to be a dimensionless number. Since the dimension of the integral is \\([r] \\cdot [g(r)] = [1]\\), it must be that \\([g(r)] = [1/r] = \\text{L}^{-1}\\). Thus, \\(g(r)\\) is not a probability simply because it is not dimensionless. Instead, in the dart example, it is a “probability-per-centimeter.” This kind of quantity—probability per something—is called a probability density and \\(g(r)\\) itself is a probability density function. To show the aptness of the word “density,” let’s switch to a graphic of a function that uses literal density of ink as the indicator of the function value. Figure 30.1 shows what the dart \\(g(r)\\) might look like: ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Figure 30.1: Showing a probability density function for the dart distance in two modes: 1) an ordinary function graph and 2) the density of ink. Example 30.1 Why a probability density function is often a good way to describe what you know about a situation. As an example, we’ll consider a simple competition of the sort you might encounter at a fund-raising fair. There is a jar on display, filled with coins that have been donated by one of the fair’s sponsors. You pay $1 (which goes to a good cause) to enter the contest. Your play is to describe how much money is in the jar, writing your description down along with your name on an entry form. At the end of the day, an official will open the jar, count the money, and announce who made the best estimate. The winner gets the money in the jar. In the usual way these contests are run, the contestants each write down a guess for the amount they think is in the jar, say $18.63. The winner is determined by seeing whose guess was closest to the actual value of the coins in the jar. In reality, hardly anyone believes they can estimate the amount in the jar to the nearest penny. The person guessing $18.63 might prefer to be able to say, “between 18 and 19 dollars.” Or, maybe “$18 \\(\\pm 3\\).” To communicate what you know about the situation, it’s best to express a range of possibilities that you think likely. In our contest, we’ll ask the participants to describe their conclusions about the jar as a probability density function. For you, having worked through this book to this point, it would be sufficient for the instructions to say, “Hand in your probability density function for the amount of money in the jar.” But we would like even people who haven’t learned calculus to participate. So our instructions will state, “On the graph-paper axes below, sketch a continuous function expressing your best belief about how much money is in the jar. At all inputs, the function value must be zero or greater.”3 Figure 30.2: The entry form for the money-in-the-jar contest. Take a minute to look at the picture of the jar and draw your function on the axes shown above. Think about why we don’t need to scale the vertical axis on the entry form and don’t ask you to do it either. Here are three contest entries. Figure 30.3: Three contestants’ contest entries. Later in this chapter, we will work with methods that construct relative density functions. The “relative” means that the function clearly indicates where the probability is more or less dense, but the function has not yet been scaled to be a probability density function. Suppose \\(h(x)\\) is a relative density function such that \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty h(x)\\, dx = A \\neq 1\\ .\\] Although \\(h(x)\\) is not a probability density function, the very closely related function \\(\\frac{1}{A} h(x)\\) will be a probability density function. We’ll use the term normalizing to refer to the simple process of turning a relative density function into a probability density function. A relative density function is entirely adequate for describing the distribution of probability. However, when comparing two or more probability distributions, it’s important that they all be on the same scale. Normalizing the relative density functions to probability density functions accomplishes this. Figure 30.4 compares the three relative probability functions in Figure 30.3. Figure 30.4: Comparing the contest entries by normalizing each of them to a probability density function. 30.2 Three density functions Three commonly used families of probability density functions are: the gaussian density function the exponential density function the uniform density function. The uniform density function, \\(u(x, a, b)\\) is more or less the equivalent of the constant function. The family has two parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with the function defined as: \\[\\begin{equation}\\text{unif}(x, a, b) \\equiv \\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\\frac{1}{b-a} &amp; \\text{for}\\ a \\leq x \\leq b\\\\0&amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array}\\right. \\tag{30.1} \\end{equation}\\] This function is used to express the idea of “equally likely to be any value in the range \\([a, b]\\).” For instance, to describe a probability that a January event is equally likely to occur at any point in the month, you can use \\(u(x, 1, 31)\\) where \\(x\\) and the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have dimension T and are in units of days. Notice that the density itself has dimension T-1 and units “per day.” Figure 30.5: The uniform density function. The gaussian density function, $(x, , ) is familiar to you from previous blocks in this book: the bell-shaped function. It’s known also as the normal distribution because it is so frequently encountered in practice. It is a way of expressing, “The outcome of the event will likely be close to this particular value.” The parameter named mean specifies “this particular value.” The parameter sd specifies what’s mean by “close.” The gaussian density function is smooth. It is never zero, but \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty} dnorm(x, \\text{mean}, \\text{sd}) = 0\\). Figure 30.6: Gaussian probability density. The labels show the probability mass in each division. To use an analogy between physical density (e.g., kg per cubic-meter), where density times size gives mass, we can say that the total mass of a probability density function is always 1. For the gaussian density, 68% of of the total mass is within \\(\\pm 1\\)sd of the mean, 95% is within \\(\\pm 2\\)sd of the mean, 99.7% within \\(\\pm 3\\)sd, and 99.99% within \\(\\pm 4\\)sd. The exponential probability density is shaped just like an exponential function \\(e^{-kx}\\). It’s used to describe events that are equally likely to happen in any interval of the input variable, and describes the relative probability that the first event to occur will be at \\(x\\). Figure 30.7: Exponential density Example 30.2 Do I want to do the beta distribution as an example? Not strictly needed unless I do some exercises with the driverless-car example. 30.3 Mean and variance As you know, the gaussian function has two parameters: mean and sd. The mean describes the center of the distribution, the sd describes the width. You may also be familiar with the statistic called the arithmetic mean. You calculate the statistic by adding up a set of \\(n\\) numbers and dividing by \\(n\\), that is, \\[\\text{mean} \\equiv \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\ ,\\] where \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of a data frame with and \\(x\\) is one of the columns. To illustrate, consider the Zcalc::Home_utilities data frame which has data on the monthly use of electricity and natural gas by a Minnesota household. The R/mosaic function for the calculation of the arithmetic mean is df_stats(). (The name stands for “data frame stats.”) Here’s a calculation of the mean outdoor temperature from Home_utilities: df_stats(~ temp, data = Zcalc::Home_utilities, mean) ## response mean ## 1 temp 48.08155 The result has units of degrees Fahrenheit. df_stats() can calculate many other statistics on a column of data, such as median, sd, var, quantile()s (such as quantile(0.33)), confidence intervals (ci.mean(), ci.median(), ci.sd()), and so on. In this book, we’ll use mean, sd, and var. Another technique we will use is to generate random events from a probability distribution, particularly from the gaussian, exponential, and uniform distributions. For example, the following command will construct a data frame (that’s what tibble() is for) that has a column named y that contains 100 random draws from a gaussian distribution with mean of 3 and sd of 0.5. Then the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are computed from the numbers in the simulation. Simulation &lt;- tibble( x = rnorm(100, mean=3, sd=0.5) ) head(Simulation) ## # A tibble: 6 × 1 ## x ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2.84 ## 2 3.28 ## 3 2.66 ## 4 3.11 ## 5 3.16 ## 6 3.59 df_stats( ~ x, data=Simulation, mean, sd) ## response mean sd ## 1 x 2.981404 0.4670355 The calculated mean and sd only approximate the values used in the simulation. That’s because they are based on random draws. Generating random draws from a probability density and calculating arithmetic statistics on the result is one way of computing the mean and standard deviation of the probability density. It can also be done by integration. Although it’s fair to describe the integral as a calculation of the average value, the term used professionally is expectation value. The expectation value of a quantity \\(f(x)\\) over a probability distribution is traditionally written in a distinct notation and is calculated as an integral of the quantity times the relevant probability density function. \\[{\\cal E}\\left[\\strut f(x)\\right] \\equiv \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)\\, \\text{pdf}(x)\\, dx\\ ,\\] The mean is the expectation value of \\(x\\), so the mean of a quantity with a gaussian distribution is \\[{\\cal E}\\left[\\strut x\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\dnorm(x, \\text{mean}, \\text{sd})\\, dx\\ .\\] This integral is exactly the same as the integral for the center of mass that was presented in Section 31.4. Example 30.3 To illustrate the definition of the mean in terms of integrals, here’s the mean of a gaussian distribution. Integrate(x * dnorm(x, mean=3, sd=0.5) ~ x, domain(x=-Inf:Inf)) ## [1] 3 You might have anticipated the result, since the particular gaussian over which we are taking the mean was defined to have a mean of 3. Another important quantity to describe data or probability distributions is the variance, which is the average of the square distance from the mean. In math notation, this looks like \\[{\\cal E}\\left[\\strut (x - \\text{mean})^2\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(\\strut x - \\text{mean}\\right)^2\\, \\dnorm(x, \\text{mean}, \\text{sd})\\, dx\\ .\\] This integral is exactly the same as the integral for the moment of inertial that was presented in Section 31.4. Example 30.4 Compute the variance of a gaussian probability density. To do this, we must first know the mean, then we can carry out the integration: Integrate((x-3)^2 * dnorm(x, mean=3, sd=0.5) ~ x, domain(x=-Inf:Inf)) ## [1] 0.25 Again, you might have anticipated this result, since the variance is the square of the standard deviation (sd) and we were using a particular gaussian distribution with sd equaling 0.5. The examples above are intended to demonstrate how the mean and variance can be calculated from a probability density function. It’s often useful to try out a calculation in a setting where you already know the answer! To illustrate the calculations in another setting, we will use an exponential probability function. Just as the R function dnorm() gives the density of the “normal”/gaussian distribution, the R function dexp() outputs the density of the exponential distribution. We used \\(k\\) as the parameter in the exponential distribution. In R, the parameter is framed in terms of the rate at which events happen, that is, the expected number of events per unit time. For instance, the following integrals compute the mean and standard deviation of an exponential process where events happen on average twice per time unit. Integrate(x * dexp(x, rate=2) ~ x, domain(x=0:Inf)) ## [1] 0.5 The result shouldn’t surprise you. If events are occurring on average twice per unit time, the average time between events should be 0.5 time units. Here’s the variance of the same distribution Integrate((x-0.5)^2 * dexp(x, rate=2) ~ x, domain(x=0:Inf)) ## [1] 0.25 It works out that for an exponential distribution with parameter \\(k\\), the mean is \\(1/k\\) and the standard deviation (square root of the variance) is also \\(1/k\\). Finally, let’s look at the mean and variance of a uniform distribution with, say, \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=10\\). We can do this symbolically or numerically. For the mean: \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x\\ \\text{unif}(x, 0, 10)\\, dx = \\int_0^{10} \\frac{x}{10-0}\\, dx = \\left.{\\Large\\strut} \\frac{x^2}{20}\\right|_{x=0}^{10} \\\\= \\frac{100}{20} - \\frac{0}{20} = 5\\] For the variance, \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-5)^2\\ \\text{unif}(x, 0, 10)\\, dx = \\int_0^{10} \\frac{(x-5)^2}{10-0}\\, dx = \\left.{\\Large\\strut}\\frac{(x-5)^3}{30}\\right|_{x=0}^{10}\\\\ =\\frac{5^3}{30} - \\frac{(-5)^3}{30} = \\frac{125}{30} - \\frac{-125}{30} = 8 \\tiny{\\frac{1}{3}}\\] Or, numerically4 Integrate(x * dunif(x, 0, 10) ~ x, domain(x=0:Inf)) ## [1] 5.000001 Integrate((x-5)^2 * dunif(x, 0, 10) ~ x, domain(x=-0:Inf)) ## [1] 8.333336 30.4 Risk and data In this section, we’ll examine the accepted technique for combining data with probability density functions in order to combine previous knowledge with new observations. The technique, called Bayesian inference, is used throughout science and engineering. (Surprisingly, satisfactory computer algorithms to do the calculations were invented only in the last 40 years; this is a modern topic.) Up to this point we’ve worked with different kinds of mathematical entities involving probability. Relative density functions: The domain is a possible outcome from a random event, the output is a non-negative quantity. Examples: The jar contest entries. Probability density functions. Much like relative density functions but with the added restriction that the definite integral over the domain produces the dimensionless number 1. Example: gaussian function. Probability. A dimensionless number between 0 and 1. Another kind of mathematical entity that plays a central role in probability calculations—particularly those that involve data—is the likelihood function. In everyday speech, the word “likelihood” is a synonym for “probability.” But the technical word “likelihood,” in the nomenclature of the calculus of probability, means something utterly different from “relative density function” or “probability density function.” Example 30.5 It’s time to calculate who won the jar-of-coins contest! When last we encountered the contest, we had translated the contest entries from their initial, unnormalized form as relative density functions into their properly normalized probability-density-function format as shown in Figure 30.4. Now we are going to build a likelihood function that will tell us the winner. The starting point is data. The officials have opened the jar and carefully counted the money. There was $32.14 in the jar. The domain of this likelihood function is the t.hree contestants, Johnny, Louisa, and Geoff. (Later, we’ll work with likelihood functions where the domain is a continuous quantity.) The output of the likelihood function is the probability density assigned to the observed $32.14. For ease of reference, Figure 30.4 has been annotated with a faint vertical line marking the position of $32.14 in the domain. You can read off the value of the likelihood from that graph. The convention in denoting a likelihood function with an input \\(x\\) is \\({\\cal L}(x | D)\\), where \\(D\\) is the data. The vertical bar in \\(x | D\\) is a subtle reminder to the experienced that the \\(D\\) is not an input to the function but a given quantity: the observed data. In fact, the word “data” comes from the Latin for “given.” Once we have observed and recorded data, it is fixed: given. For this example, the observed, given amount is $32.14 The domain \\(x\\) in the likelihood function for the contest is the set {Johnny, Louisa, Geoff}. We can present the likelihood in tabular form: \\(x\\) \\({\\cal L}(\\,x\\ |\\ \\$32.14)\\) Johnny 0.000 per dollar Louisa 0.010 per dollar Geoff 0.066 per dollar The units, “per dollar,” are needed because the output of \\({\\cal L}(x | \\$32.14)\\) is a probability density function. But the likelihood function itself is not a probability density function, it merely reports the level of the three different probability density functions entered by the three contestants. One way to see that \\({\\cal L}(x | \\$32.14)\\) is not itself a probability density function is to sum the outputs over the entire domain: \\(0.000 + 0.010 + 0.066 = 0.076\\) per dollar which, obviously, is not equal to dimensionless 1. In statistics, likelihood functions are used to describe how to estimate a quantity given some data about the quantity. The techique is called maximum likelihood estimation: the estimate is the argmax of the likelihood function. For the coins-in-jar contest, the argmax is Geoff. Therefore, Geoff wins! In the spirit of “Monday morning quarterbacking,” let’s look carefully at Johnny’s entry. If his bar-shaped probability density function were shifted just a little to the right, he would have won. This illustrates a flaw in Johnny’s logic in constructing his probability density function. The function indicates that he thought the probability of the amount being $23 was the same as being 30 dollars. In other words, he was uncertain to a considerable extent. But given this uncertainty, why would he insist that $30.01 is impossible (that is, has probability density 0 per dollar). Wouldn’t it make more sense to admit nonzero density for $30.01, and similarly for $30.02 and upward, with the density gradually decreasing with the amount of money. This is why, absent very specific knowledge about the circumstances, probability densities are so often framed as Gaussian distributions, as in Geoff’s entry. We’ll illustrate the Bayesian inference process with an example about the risk of disease. The risk of a disease is presented to the public in one of two ways. An absolute risk is a number like 2% per year, that is, 1 in 50 people will get the disease each year. A relative risk is a ratio: the risk of one population of interest (e.g. smokers) divided by the risk of another group (e.g. non-smokers). Since a relative risk is the ratio of two absolute risks, it is a dimensionless non-negative number, for instance 5.4. For professionals, the risk of a disease is presented not as a single number but as a statistical range of numbers. For instance, an absolute risk might be stated as 1-3%. People who haven’t studied statistics have a hard time distinguishing between “1-3%” and “2%.” It amounts to much the same thing. To the professionals, “1-3%” conveys two different aspects of knowledge: i) the level of absolute risk—about 2% here—and 2) how much uncertainty there is in the knowledge of (i). Saying “1-3%” seems a lot like Johnny’s entry in the coins-in-jar contest. The statement has edges that are too sharp. Professionals know how to interpret “1-3%” along the lines of Geoff’s entry: a summary of a smoother distribution. There is a more complete way to state our knowledge of the risk that combines both the level of risk and the uncertainty. The representation we choose is a probability density function. To illustrate, Figure 30.8 shows three different examples of what such probability density functions might look like for risk. Each is called a prior on the risk. Figure 30.8: Three different opinions about the risk of a disease. Panel (A) in Figure 30.8 is a strong statement that the risk of disease is small. Panel (B) says, “I have no idea!” Panel (C) expresses the belief that the risk is around 10%, but there is a great deal of uncertainty. How to construct such statements when you have some evidence for the risk of the disease. For instance, evidence might be the results of screening tests on \\(n = 10\\) randomly selected people. Each screening test produces a positive result (we’ll write “+”) or a negative result (“-”). People seem to interpret such results as indicating that they have the disease (+) or don’t have the disease (-). But this is a wrong interpretation. In order to make sense of a screening test, you need to know two probabilities. These are: The probability of a + test in a group of people with the disease. The probability of a - test in a group of people without the disease. We’ll call these two probabilities \\(p_d(+)\\) and \\(p_h(-)\\) where the subscript indicates whether we are referring to the probability in the disease group (\\(p_d\\)) or in the no-disease (“healthy”) group (\\(p_h\\)). For definiteness, we’ll imagine a test where \\(p_d(+) = 80\\%\\) and \\(p_h(-) = 90\\%\\).5 In a perfect test, \\(p_d(+)\\) and \\(p_h(-)\\) would both be 100%. Our imagined test, like real-world screening tests, is imperfect. Given this information about the performance of the test, we can construct two likelihood functions. Each will be a function of the risk level \\(R\\). The two functions will differ in that one describes the likelihood of \\(R\\) given a positive test; the other describes the likelihood of \\(R\\) given a negative test. Keep in mind that \\(0 \\leq R \\leq 100\\%\\) is the probability that the person being tested has the disease. \\({\\cal L}(R | +)\\) is the likelihood of a + test for any given level of \\(R\\). There are two cases to consider: You have the disease, in which case the probability of \\(+\\) is \\(p_d(+) = 0.8\\) for our example. You do not have the disease, in which case the probability of \\(+\\) is \\(1-p_h(-) = 0.1\\).6 Since you might or might not have the disease, we have to put (a) and (b) together based on the probability \\(R\\) that you have the disease. Consequently, \\[{\\cal L}(R | +) = p_d(+)\\ R + (1-p_h(-))\\ (1-R) = 0.8 R + 0.1 (1-R)\\] where \\(1-R\\) is the probability that you don’t have the disease. A similar calculation gives the likelihood of \\(R\\) given a \\(-\\) test: \\[{\\cal L}(R | -) = (1-p_d(+))\\ R + p_h(-)\\, (1-R)\\ .\\] In Bayesian inference, we will start with a probability density function expressing what we know (or, more precisely, “believe”) about the risk of disease. This is called our prior belief and it’s in the form of a probability density function. Then, as data comes in, we update our beliefs on the basis of the data. The prior can also be in the form of a relative density function, since we can normalize a relative density to become a probability density function. After we have updated our prior, our state of knowledge is called a posterior belief. The posterior also has the form of a probability density function, but of course a relative density function will do just as well. The formula for updating is called Bayes Rule: posterior is likelihood times prior. \\[\\text{posterior}(R) = {\\cal L}(R | \\text{data}) \\times \\text{prior}(R)\\ .\\] Imagine that we have just heard about a newly discovered disease and have a screening test for it. Any of the three priors shown in Figure 30.8 could be a reasonable starting point. The prior shown in panel (B) is a state of complete ignorance. But it can be argued that “newly discovered” is a big hint about the risk and so a reasonable person might prefer to start with the priors in panels (A) or (C) instead. The calculations are simple, so we’ll trace them through for all three different priors, (A), (B), and (C). Suppose our first observations are the results of screening tests on ten randomly selected individuals. Subject ID Test outcome 4349A \\(+\\) 7386A \\(-\\) 6263E \\(+\\) 5912C \\(-\\) 7361C \\(-\\) 9384C \\(-\\) 6312A \\(-\\) 3017C \\(+\\) 1347B \\(-\\) 9611D \\(-\\) To summarize: Three \\(+\\) tests out of ten. After the first test outcome is available we can calculate the posterior: \\[\\text{posterior}_1 (R | +) = {\\cal L}(R | -) \\times \\text{prior(R)}\\ .\\] After the second test outcome, the new posterior is \\[\\text{posterior}_2 (R) = {\\cal L}(R | -) \\times {\\cal L}(R | +) \\times \\text{prior(R)}\\ .\\] And after the third (a \\(+\\) result!) it will be \\[\\text{posterior}_3 (R) = {\\cal L}(R | +) \\times {\\cal L}(R | -) \\times {\\cal L}(R | +) \\times \\text{prior(R)}\\ .\\] We continue on in this way through all ten rows of the data to get the posterior distribution. Figure 30.10 shows the posterior after the 10 rows of data have been considered for each of the three priors from Figure 30.8. Figure 30.9: Posteriors (blue) after the first screening test, which was \\(+\\), for each of the priors in Figure 30.8. The prior itself is drawn in gray. With just one row of data considered, the priors depend very much on the particular posterior selected. Figure 30.10: Posteriors (blue) after the first ten rows of data, for each of the priors in Figure 30.8. The prior itself is drawn in gray. After the first 10 rows of data have been considered, the priors are similar despite the different priors. Figure 30.11: Posteriors (blue) after 100 subjects have been screen, with 30 \\(+\\) results. As data accumulates, the priors become irrelevant; the knowledge about the risk of disease is being driven almost entirely by the data. 30.5 Exercises OK, so we’re assuming that the contestants know what a function is, what an input is, and what a graph is. So maybe it does take some calculus background to participate.↩︎ Numerical integrals from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\) of functions that are zero almost everywhere are challenging. The computer has to figure out where, out of the whole number line, the function has non-zero output. We’ve given the computer a head start by using 0 in the limits of integration. This would not be a problem for the exponential or gaussian distribution, which are non-zero everywhere (for the gaussian) or for half the number line (for the exponential).↩︎ In news reports, you may often hear about the accuracy of a screening test. Here, the accuracy would be between 80 and 90%. But “accuracy” is not a complete way to describe a test and can be very misleading. You need two numbers to describe the performance of a screening test.↩︎ Make sure you’re comfortable with this statement. Here’s the justification: \\(p_h(-)\\) is the probability that a person without the disease has a \\(-\\) test. Since in our example the only alternative to a \\(-\\) test outcome is a \\(+\\) test outcome, the probability that a person without the disease has a \\(+\\) test is \\(1 - p_h(-)\\).↩︎ "],["mechanics.html", "Chapter 31 Mechanics 31.1 Work 31.2 Energy 31.3 Momentum 31.4 Center of mass 31.5 Angular momentum and torque 31.6 Exercises", " Chapter 31 Mechanics In Block 2, we introduced the ideas of instantaneous rate of change and infinitesimal intervals of time. These are mathematical concepts introduced in the 17th century for describing motion. (In the 16th century, Galileo’s measurements of motion involved averages over finite time intervals.) With this new mathematical tool, Newton was able to propose and confirm laws of motion. Velocity of an object is its instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time. Acceleration of an object is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time. With these abstract concepts, Newton was able to connect motion to the palpable forces acting on objects. Thus was born the field of dynamics, the study of forces and their effects on motion. A dynamic process is one that is characterized by constant change: motion. In contrast, statics is about physical systems that do not change. A non-changing system is said to be in equilibrium or balance. Static systems are incredibly important in everyday life; a bridge that is not static is one that you do not want to cross! The equilibrium in a bridge is the balance between the downward force of gravity and the compression and tensile forces in the materials that make up the bridge. Mechanics a catch-all term for the combination of statics and dynamics studied in physics and used in engineering and design. Today it’s common to think of a “mechanic” as a person who works with machines; the sense we have in mind here is the study of machines, with the “-ic” signifying “practice of” in the sense of scientific, physics, mathematics, optics, chiropractic, and such. “Simple machine” is a Renaissance-era term for a device that changes the direction or strength of forces. The classical simple machines are the lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. “Mechanics” as a field originated in the study of such devices and development of theoretical concepts to describe them. It went on to deal with more complicated machine components such as a gas-filled cylinder and piston, flywheel, valve, turbine, etc. Many concepts from these theory are intuitive to the modern mind: force, pressure, momentum. This chapter is about the role of calculus concepts and methods, especially the calculus of accumulation/integration are applied in mechanics. 31.1 Work “Work” is a familiar, everyday concept, but a nuanced one; one person’s work can be another person’s play. In mechanics, work has a much more specific meaning stemming from the study of simple machines. A lever, for instance, can be used to move an object that is otherwise too heavy to handle. It still takes toil and effort to move the object, but the effort is eased by the mechanics of the lever. Our intuitive sense of work is perhaps rooted in physiology: effort, fatigue, muscle pain. For instance, it takes work to pick up a heavy object, but it is also work to hold the object up even without moving it. Generations of thinking about machines has brought us to a different notion of work that doesn’t involve human subjectivity. In mechanics, holding an object steady, no matter how heavy, does not involve work. Although a human tasked to hold a heavy load will become exhausted, the same duty can be accomplished by placing the load on a table, completely eliminating the effort. In mechanics, work and motion go hand in hand; without motion there is no work. The table holding the heavy load does no work. Work is done only when the load is moved, and the amount of work depends on how the load is moved. For instance, moving a block along level ground involves a lot of work, but pulling a cart filled with blocks can be almost effortless. In mechanics, work combines both the amount of motion and the force needed to accomplish the motion. Work is force times displacement. Consider, for instance, the work involved in lifting a mass \\(m\\) to table height \\(h\\). The lifting is accomplished by applying an upward force to counter the force of gravity. The gravitational force on the mass is \\(m g\\), where \\(g\\) is the instantaneous acceleration of an object released to fall freely (about 9.8 m/s2 near the Earth’s surface). The distance traveled is \\(h\\). So the work performed on the mass is \\(m g h\\). Notice that the work has nothing to do with the speed with which the mass is moved up to the table. Lift it fast or lift it slow, it amounts to the same mechanical work. (Of course, to human perception, lifting an object very slowly up to table height involves more effort than snapping it up quickly. But human effort is only peripherally related to mechanical work.) Let’s introduce a machine to the situation in the form of a ramp or a pulley. The purpose of the machine is to ease human labor by changing the strength or direction of forces. You can perhaps intuit that rolling the mass up the ramp will be an easier task than lifting it. How so? The ramp can be seen as a sort of partial table. The ramp does most of what’s needed to hold the mass up, the human worker need only supply a modest additional force, parallel to the ramp surface, to keep the mass in place. Calculating that modest additional force can be accomplished by a basic mathematical technique in mechanics: decomposing a vector. You’ve already encountered vectors (in Section 24.3) in the context of the gradient vector, the vector that points in the steepest uphill direction of a function \\(f(x,y)\\) at any given input \\((x,y)\\). Recall that the gradient vector was written as a set of values; the partial derivative of \\(f()\\) with respect to each of its inputs in turn. That is, \\[\\nabla f(x,y) = \\left({\\large\\strut} \\partial_x f(x,y),\\ \\ \\partial_y f(x,y)\\right)\\ .\\] In this representation, the vector \\(\\nabla f(x, y)\\) is decomposed into two components: \\(\\partial_x f(x,y)\\) and \\(\\partial_y f(x,y)\\). Similarly, we can decompose the vector of gravitational force into two components, one along the surface of the ramp and the other perpendicular to the ramp. Figure 31.1: Decomposing the vector of gravitational force into two, perpendicular components, one tangent to the ramp and the other perpendicular to it. We’ll return to the idea of vector decomposition in much more detail in Block 5 of this course; it has a major (though perhaps unexpected) role to play in fitting models to data. But for now, we’ll simply examine the right triangle in Figure 31.1. In that triangle, the gravitational force vector \\(F_{gravity} = m g\\) is in the role of the hypothenuse. The component along the ramp is \\(m \\sin(\\theta) g\\). The worker pushing the mass up the ramp need provide the fraction \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) as much force as the worker picking up the mass without a ramp. Thus human effort is reduced by the machine. What about the mechanical work? Is that also reduced? Remember that mechanical work is the product of force times distance. The force has been reduced to \\(m \\sin(\\theta) g\\), but the distance \\(D_{ramp}\\) along the ramp is much longer than the distance \\(h\\) from floor to table top. Again, referring to the ramp itself as a right triangle, you can see that \\(D_{ramp}\\sin(\\theta) = h\\) or, \\(D_{ramp} = h / \\sin(\\theta)\\). The total mechanical work, the product of applied force times distance moved is \\[m \\sin(\\theta) g \\times D_{ramp} = m \\sin(\\theta) g \\times \\frac{h}{\\sin(\\theta)} = m g h\\ .\\] The ramp does nothing to reduce the mechanical work needed to lift the mass! We usually think of ramps as an inclined plane. But, from Blocks 1 to 3 we have the tools to figure out the work for a (smooth) ramp with any shape at all. We’re going to do this not because odd-shaped ramps are encountered frequently, but to provide an example in a relatively familiar setting of some techniques we will use elsewhere in this chapter. The ramp we have in mind has a surface whose height \\(f(x)\\) is zero at the foot (\\(x=a\\)) and reaches \\(f(x=b) = h\\) where it joins the table. The slope of the ramp is, as you know, \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\). It’s helpful to convert this rise/run formulation of slope into the slope-angle form we used to study the simple ramp. [Zoomed in theta diagram here.] As you can see from the diagram, which zooms in on one place on the ramp, rise over run amounts to \\(L\\sin(\\theta) / L\\cos(\\theta) = \\partial_x f(x) = \\tan(\\theta)\\), with the result: \\[\\theta = \\arctan({\\large\\strut}\\partial_x f(x))\\ .\\] Consequently, the force that needs to be applied parallel to the ramp’s surface is \\(m \\sin(\\arctan(\\partial_x f(x))) g = m \\sin(theta) g\\). To find the work done in pushing the mass an infinitesimal distance along the ramp we need to know the instantaneous length of the ramp. This is potentially confusing to the new reader since we’ve already said that the distance is infinitesimal. But as you know, infinitesimal length is different from zero length. We’ll write \\(dx\\) as an infinitesimal increment along the floor, but the zoomed-in surface of the ramp is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg has length \\(dx\\) and the other has length slope times distance or \\(\\partial_x f(x) dx\\). The hypotenuse of the infinitesimal segment of the ramp has length \\(dL = \\sqrt{\\strut dx + \\partial_x f(x) dx}\\), or \\(dL = \\sqrt{\\strut 1 + \\partial_x f(x)}\\ dx\\). Things are a bit simpler if we write \\(dL\\) in terms of the slope angle \\(\\theta\\). Since \\(dx = \\cos(\\theta) dL\\), we know \\(dL = dx/\\cos(\\theta)\\). Consequently the infinitesimal of work is \\[dW \\ = \\ m g \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\ dx\\ = \\ m g \\tan(\\theta) dx \\ .\\] The total work is the accumulation of \\(dW\\) over the extent of the ramp. In other words, \\[\\int_a^b m g \\tan(\\theta)\\ dx\\ = \\ \\int_a^b m g \\tan(\\arctan(\\partial_x f(x)))\\ dx = \\int_a^b m g \\partial_x f(x) dx\\ ,\\] where we’ve used the formula \\(\\theta = \\arctan(\\partial_x f(x))\\). From the “fundamental theorem of calculus” we know that \\[\\int_a^b m g\\ \\partial_x f(x)\\ dx \\ = \\ \\left.m g \\ f(x){\\Large\\strut}\\right|_a^b = mg \\left[\\strut f(b) - f(a)\\right] = mg h\\ .\\] What’s remarkable is that pushing the mass up the \\(f(x)\\)-shaped ramp involves an amount of work, \\(m g h\\), that does not depend on \\(f(x)\\), only on \\(f(b) - f(a)\\), the net height comprised by the ramp. We haven’t yet said what this notion of work is good for and we’ve given no detailed justification for the definition of mechanical work as force times distance. You could imagine, for instance, someone deciding to measure work as the square-root of force times distance squared. But … that particular measure is not going to make sense if we think about the dimension of the quantity. Force has dimension [force] = M L T-2. Square root of force times length squared would have dimension [sqrt(force) \\(\\times\\) length-squared] = M1/2 L5/2 T-2. The non-integer exponents mean that this is not a legitimate physical quantity. The dimension of force-times-length are straightforward: [force \\(\\times\\) length] = M L2 T-2, that is, energy. The particular definition of work as force times length will make sense in the context of a more comprehensive mechanical theory of energy. The significance of energy itself is that, as a fundamental proposition of physics, the various forms of energy are interchangeable but conserved; energy is neither created nor destroyed, just moved around from one form to another and one place to another. Example 31.1 Near the surface of the Earth, gravitational acceleration is approximately constant regardless of latitude or longitude. But gravity varies with distance \\(r\\) from the Earth’s center. Newton’s law of universal gravitation gives the force on an object of mass \\(m\\) due to the Earth’s gravity as \\[F = \\frac{m M_e G}{r^2}\\] where \\(M_e = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg is the mass of the Earth and \\(G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}\\) N m2 / kg2 is the universal gravitational constant. The Earth’s radius is roughly \\(6.37 \\times 10^6\\) m, so the force on a 1 kg object near the surface of the Earth is \\(F = 1 \\text{kg} (5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\text{kg}) (6.674 \\times 10^{-11})/ (6.37 \\times 10^6 \\text{m})^2\\) N m2 kg-2. Carrying out the arithmetic and consolidating the units gives \\[F = 9.823 N\\] for the 1 kg object. Suppose we want to lift the 1 kg object from the Earth’s surface to 10000 km away, that is, to a distance of \\(16.37 \\times 10^6\\) m from the center of the Earth. For the purpose of the example, we’ll ignore the gravitational force exerted by the Sun, Moon, planets, and other galaxies, etc. The work performed in the lifting is \\[\\int_{6.47\\times 10^6}^{16.47\\times 10^6} \\frac{1 \\text{kg}\\ M_e\\ G}{r^2}\\ dr = -\\left. {\\Large\\strut}\\frac{1 \\text{kg}\\ M_e\\ G}{r}\\right|_{6.47\\times 10^6}^{16.47\\times 10^6} \\\\\\ \\\\\\ \\\\= -\\ 3.986 \\times 10^{14}\\left[\\strut \\frac{1}{16.47 \\times 10^6} - \\frac{1}{6.47 \\times 10^6}\\right] \\text{N m} \\\\\\ \\\\\\ \\\\= 37,405,840\\ \\text{J}.\\] A Newton-meter (N m) is also known as a Joule (J), a unit of energy. With 37,000,000 J, you could toast about 2000 pieces of bread. 31.2 Energy Mechanical work, as discussed in the previous section, is a form of energy. When we lift a object, we put energy into the object. But we cannot say from examining the object how much work was done to place it on the table. That depends on how the object came to be on the table: lifted from the floor (positive work; force is positive upward, displacement is also positive upward) or perhaps lowered from a helicopter (negative work: force exerted by the cable is positive upward but the displacement is downward, therefore negative). We might call the work energy latent, the word meaning “unobservable,” “hidden,” “concealed,” “dormant.” To have an operational meaning, the work-energy that we assign to an object at rest must be with respect to some “ground state.” A convenient ground state here is to imagine the object resting on the ground. The assigned energy will then be the work that would have to be performed to raise the object to table height. Once at table height, the energy is again latent. How then to measure the work energy that’s latent in the object resting on the table? The idea is to return the object to its ground state, which we could do by lowering it—a negative displacement—to the ground, measuring the force needed to support the object (upward, so positive) and multiplying this by the displacement. Another idea for measuring the latent energy is to let the object fall freely back toward its ground state and see what changes about the object. Perhaps you have already caught on to what will happen: the object’s speed increases steadily until the instant before it hits the ground. “Latent” is an apt but unusual word to express the energy imbued in the object resting on the table. We might equally say that the energy is “associated with position (at the height the table),” or we could call it “gravitational energy.” The term that’s generally used is a near synonym of “latent.” We call the energy of the stationary object on the table potential energy. More precisely it can be called gravitational potential energy to distinguish it from the potential energy created by other forms of work, for instance pulling apart magnets or electric charges or compressing a gas into a cylinder. There’s also a form of energy associated with motion. We could call this “energy of motion,” but the conventional term is kinetic energy. (A dictionary definition of “kinetic” is “relating to or resulting from motion.” so we might as well say simply that kinetic energy is \"energy relating to motion.) Velocity is a good way to observe motion. We can use dimensional analysis to anticipate how velocity and (kinetic) energy are related. Recall that energy has dimension M L2 T-2 and velocity has dimension L/T. Consequently, if an object’s kinetic energy at any instant stems from its mass and its velocity, then the energy must be mass times velocity squared, perhaps multiplied by a scalar, that is: \\[E_{kinetic} = a m v^2\\ .\\] To find this scalar, we’ll use calculus and accumulation. We know that the acceleration of a free-falling object due to gravity is \\(-g\\) (where the negative sign reflects the downward direction). Starting from rest (that is zero velocity so zero kinetic energy) the newly released mass will have a velocity that is the accumulated acceleration over time. In other words: \\[v(t) = \\int_0^t - g\\ dt = -\\left.g \\ t{\\large\\strut}\\right|_0^t = -g\\ t\\ .\\] Correspondingly, the position at time \\(t\\) will be the accumulated velocity: \\[x(t) = x(t=0) + \\int_0^t v(t) dt = h + \\int_0^t -g\\ t\\ dt = h - \\frac{1}{2} \\left.g\\ t^2{\\Large\\strut}\\right|_0^t = h - \\frac{1}{2} g\\ t^2 \\ .\\] The position is relevant only because we want to figure out the velocity at precisely the instant \\(t_g\\) when the object returns to its ground state, \\(x(t_g)=0\\). By plugging in \\(t=t_g\\) to the above, and re-arranging, we find that the object returns to its ground state when \\(h - \\frac{1}{2} g\\ t_g^2 = 0\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\ t_g = \\sqrt{\\strut 2 h/g}\\). Now that we know the time when the object reaches its ground state, we can calculate the velocity at that instant: \\[v(t_g) = -g\\ t_g = - g\\ \\sqrt{\\strut 2 h / g} = - \\sqrt{\\strut 2 g h}\\] As the object reaches its ground state, its gravitation potential energy is zero (because it’s at the ground state) and, if energy is conserved and assuming that no other forms of energy are relevant but kinetic and gravitational potential energy, the kinetic energy will be the same size as the potential energy at \\(t=0\\) when the object was released from the table, that is \\[E_{kinetic}(t_g) = a\\ m\\ v(t_g)^2 = = a\\ m \\left(\\sqrt{\\strut 2 g h\\ }\\ \\right)^2 = \\\\\\ \\\\2\\, a\\, m\\, g\\, h\\ = m\\, g\\, h = E_{potential}(t=0)\\] Example 31.2 In the previous section, we calculated the potential energy of a 1 kg object at an altitude of 10,000 km above the Earth’s surface: 37,405,840 J. How fast would the 1 kg object need to be moving to have this much kinetic energy? \\[\\frac{1}{2} (1 \\text{kg}) v^2 = 37,405,840 \\text{J} = 37,405,840 \\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^2\\ \\text{t}^{-2}\\] Solving for \\(v\\) we get \\(v^2 = 2 \\times 37,405,840 \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^2\\ \\text{t}^{-2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}\\) or \\[v = 8649.4\\ \\text{m}/\\text{s}\\ ,\\] about eight-and-a-half kilometers per second. The photograph (source) shows a simple exercise: holding a dumbbell out horizontally. As anyone who does this exercise can tell you, even when there is no movement of the dumbbell, there is a strong sense of work being done. Your muscle fatigues and, for most people, the dumbbells can be held in place for only a short time. We’ve said that mechanical work always involves motion; no motion, no work. So how come the exercise feels like work even though the hands do not move? To perform the exercise, you contract the muscles of the shoulder and upper arm. There is no skeletal joint that can be locked in place (unlike, say, the knee). It is only the muscle force that holds the arms in place. On the size scale that we normally perceive, it can appear that nothing is moving during the exercise. But zoom in to the molecular scale to see the action by which force is generated by muscle. The functional unit of muscle force involves two proteins, actin and myosin, that interact in a complicated way. The animation (from the online textbook by Michael D. Mann, The Nervous System in Action, chapter 14) shows the situation. The “head” of a myosin unit (red) acts like an oar. It attaches to a site on the actin molecule (orange) causing the head to contract and pull on the actin. Once contracted, a molecule of ATP (green sphere) binds to the myosin, releasing the head and preparing it for another stroke. ATP is an organic molecule that serves as a primary energy carrier and is found in all known forms of life. Transformation of ATP to ADP releases the energy. The ADP is then cycled, though other metabolic processes, back into ATP. This happens rapidly. Humans recycle approximately their own body weight in ATP each day. Figure 31.2: Animation of the generation of force by the interaction of actin and myosin, from The Nervous System in Action. When muscle is under tension, the actin can slip back in between strokes of the myosin head. Thus, a constant-length muscle in tension on a macroscopic scale is steadily consuming energy, in much the same way as an oarsman on an anchored boat can do work via the movement of oars against the water even when the boat itself is not moving. 31.3 Momentum In the previous sections we looked at force \\(\\times\\) distance. Dimensional analysis showed that [force \\(\\times\\) distance] = energy and, in the setting of lifting an object and letting it fall back toward its ground state, we traced out the conversion of the energy of position (“potential energy”) into the energy of velocity (“kinetic energy”). Now consider a somewhat different quantity: force \\(\\times\\) time. Dimensional analysis gives \\[\\underbrace{M^1 L^1 \\ T^{-2}}_\\text{[force]}\\ \\times\\ \\underbrace{T}_\\text{[time]} = \\underbrace{M^1}_\\text{[mass]} \\underbrace{L^1 T^{-1}}_\\text{[velocity]} \\] The product of force times time is dimensionally equivalent to the product of mass times velocity. The quantity is called momentum. Newton’s second law of motion, often written in terms of acceleration, \\(F = m a\\), is more fundamentally written in terms of momentum: \\(F = \\partial_t\\, m\\, v\\). The conservation of momentum refers to the situation when outside forces on a system are nil. In such case, momentum of the system doesn’t change with time; momentum is constant or “conserved.” An example of such a system is a deep-space probe, sufficiently far from other matter that gravitational force is negligible. In order to speed up or slow down (or turn), the probe is made to throw out fast moving molecules of burnt fuel. These particles have “new” momentum, but since momentum of the whole system is conserved, the body of the probe gains “new” momentum in the opposite direction. This is the operating principle of the rocket engine. Figure 31.3: Left: A turbojet engine uses air for combustion and emits a relatively low amount of mass at high velocity. Right: A turbofan engine uses a fan blade (1) to convert some of the combustion energy into a large mass of relatively slow velocity, unburnt air. Figure 31.4: Left: A turbojet engine uses air for combustion and emits a relatively low amount of mass at high velocity. Right: A turbofan engine uses a fan blade (1) to convert some of the combustion energy into a large mass of relatively slow velocity, unburnt air. Aircraft jet engines work in a similar matter, burning fuel to create energy. Whereas the force generated by a rocket engine is entirely produced by the newly created momentum of the burnt fuel, aircraft engines have an additional material to work with: air. The earliest jet engines, turbojet engines, were small in diameter, bringing in air mainly as a fuel for combustion. (Figure ?? left7 Today’s more efficient engines are large diameter: turbofan engines. (Figure ?? right8) In addition to using air for combustion, they use large fan blades to convert the energy of combustion into a large mass of relatively slowly moving, uncombusted air. This moving air carries momentum; more than that contained in the fast moving particles generated directly through combustion. 31.4 Center of mass In considering a physical object of extended shape, it can be a great simplification to be able to treat the whole extended object as if it were a simple point object at a single location. For instance, Figure 31.5 imagines a space probe coasting through the edge of a galaxy. Figure 31.5: An imagined space probe (orange dot) on the outer edges of a galaxy. What is the gravitational attraction of the galaxy on the probe? One way to find this is by adding up the individual gravitational attractions of the individual stars. Another is to find the center of mass of the galaxy and calculate the force as if all the mass were at that point. The two calculations give the same answer. For the galaxy, the center of mass is located at a point \\((\\bar{x},\\bar{y})\\) where \\[\\bar{x} \\equiv \\sum_\\text{galaxy} m_i x_i\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\bar{y} \\equiv \\sum_\\text{galaxy} m_i y_i\\] Figure 31.6: An irregular shape used in the example. The \\((x,y)\\) coordinates of closely spaced points on the boundary are available as Zcalc::Blob1 in the sandbox software. For a continuous shape, such as in Figure 31.6 (left) we can describe the center-of-mass calculation as finding \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{x} = \\int_\\text{A} x\\ \\rho(x,y)\\ d\\text{A} / M\\\\ \\bar{y} = \\int_\\text{A} y\\ \\rho(x,y)\\ d\\text{A} / M \\tag{31.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A\\) refers to the whole object and \\(d\\)A is a differential of the object, that is, a tiny piece of the object. The quantity \\(\\rho(x,y)\\) is the mass-density at each point in the object. Mass-density times the size of the piece \\(dA\\) gives the total mass of that piece. The total mass of the object, \\(M\\) is \\[M = \\int_\\text{A} \\rho(x,y)\\ d\\text{A}\\] There are many ways to split an object up into differential pieces so that they can be accumulated to give the whole integral. One simple way, shown in Figure 31.6 (right), is to divide the object into a set of discrete, non-overlapping, adjacent rectangles (or cubes for a three-dimensional object). Then, as with adding up the stars, just add up \\(x \\rho(x, y) d\\)A or \\(y \\rho(x,y) d\\)A contained in each of the rectangular \\(d\\)A regions. For the rectangles, the mass \\(m_i\\) of rectangle \\(i\\) will be \\(m_i = \\rho(x,y) d\\)A: density times area of each rectangle. This turns the integrals in Eq. (31.1) into a sum: \\[\\bar{x} \\approx \\sum_\\text{rectangles} m_i x_i/ M\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\bar{y} \\approx \\sum_\\text{rectangles} m_i y_i / M\\] where \\[\\sum_\\text{rectangles} m_i\\ .\\] Figure 31.7: A continuous shape can be approximated by a set of rectangles within the borders of the shape. Integrating over the shape is a matter of adding up across all of the rectangles the relevant quantity for each rectangle. For the center of mass calculation, the relevant quantity for \\(\\bar{x}\\) for each rectangle is the mass times the \\(x\\)-position. Similarly, for \\(\\bar{y}\\) the relevant quanty is the mass times the \\(y\\)-position. Figure 31.8: For the \\(y\\)-component of the center of mass (left panel), the \\(x\\)-coordinate of each rectangle is irrelevant. It is as if all the rectangles were moved to \\(x=0\\). Similarly for the \\(x\\)-component of the center of mass (right panel). Compute the center of mass of the object Zcalc::Blob1 shown in 31.6, assuming the mass-density \\(\\rho(x,y) = 10\\). The mass of the object is \\[M = \\int_\\text{Blob1} \\rho(x, y)\\, dA\\] The \\(x\\)-component of the center of mass is \\[\\bar{x} = \\int_\\text{shape} x \\rho(x, y)\\, dA / M\\] and similarly for \\(\\bar{y}\\). To find the center of mass, we first need to know the total mass of the object. We’ll carry out the calculation by dividing the object into a series of rectangles, computing the mass of each rectangle, then adding together the masses. The R/mosaic function box_set() takes as input the density function, a data frame with points on the boundary of the object, and a size for the boxes, which we’ll set to \\(dx=0.1\\). Boxes &lt;- box_set(10 ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx=0.1) Give this command in a sandbox and look at the resulting data frame Boxes. Each row is one box. x and y is the location of the center of that box, dx and dy are the lengths of the box sides in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions, .output. is the value of the function evaluated at the center of each box, and dA is the area of each box (which is simply \\(dA = dx\\, dy\\)). As the notation \\[\\int_\\text{Blob1} \\rho(x, y) dx dy\\] suggests, to accumulate the results for the individual boxes we just multiply the .output. by dA and sum. mass &lt;- with(Boxes, sum(.output. * dA)) ## [1] 67.3 Computing the \\(x\\)-component of the center of mass, \\(\\bar{x}\\), is much the same but now the function being integrated is \\(x \\rho(x,y)\\) instead of just \\(\\rho(x,y)\\): Boxes2 &lt;- box_set(10*x ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx=0.1) xbar &lt;- with(Boxes2, sum(.output. * dA)) / mass ## [1] -0.1543015 The \\(y\\) component of the center of mass, \\(\\bar{y}\\) is computed almost identically, but substituting \\(10*y ~ x &amp; y\\) as the function to be integrated. In the next line, we’ll tell box_set() to do the summation over all the boxes directly, instead of our having to do it with the with(..., sum(.output. * dA)) command. ybar &lt;- box_set(10*y ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx=0.1, sum=TRUE) / mass ## [1] -0.2371817 Recall that the summation over the boxes provides an approximation to the integral. The quality of the approximation depends on the boxes being small enough. It’s responsible to check the result by using smaller box size: ybar &lt;- box_set(10*y ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx = 0.01, sum=TRUE) / mass ybar ## [1] -0.2323201 box_set(10*y ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx = 0.001, sum=TRUE) / mass ## [1] -0.2322872 From this, we conclude that a box size dx = 0.01 gives 4 digits precision, but dx = 0.1 was not small enough. We’ll repeat the calculation for \\(\\bar{x}\\) to get the same precision: xbar &lt;- box_set(10*x ~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx = 0.01, sum=TRUE) / mass 31.5 Angular momentum and torque The relationship between force and momentum is familiar: \\[F = \\partial_t\\, m\\, v =\\ \\underbrace{m \\ \\partial_t\\ v}_\\text{if mass is constant}\\ .\\] Of course, the derivative of velocity with respect to time is also called “acceleration.” Consider the following situation. A space probe is being acted on by a constant force, as in Figure ??. The mass of the probe is \\(m\\), the thrust from the rocket engine (red triangle) provides the force \\(F\\). Starting from velocity \\(\\partial_t y(t=0)\\) and position \\(y(t=0) = 0\\), the thrust produces an acceleration \\(\\partial_{tt} y(t) = F/m\\). Integrating the acceleration gives the velocity as a function of time \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial_t y(t) = \\frac{F}{m} t\\ . \\tag{31.2} \\end{equation}\\] Our task is to translate the \\(y(t)\\)-position into an angle \\(\\theta(t)\\) as seen from the planet so that we can find the equation of motion in terms of \\(\\theta\\), that is \\[\\partial_{tt} \\theta(t) = {\\Large ?}\\] The derivation of \\(\\partial_{tt} \\theta(t)\\) will perhaps not be obvious, but you should be able to follow the role of calculus operations in each step. We’ll write it in terms of the constants \\(F\\) and \\(m\\), and the functions \\(D(t)\\), \\(\\theta(t)\\), and \\(y(t) = \\frac{F}{m}t\\). Note that the probe’s starting point, the planet’s position, and the probe’s position at time \\(t\\) form a right triangle. The length of the horizontal leg of the triangle is constant: \\(D(0)\\) which, for brevity, we’ll write \\(D_0\\). The vertical leg has length \\(y(t)\\), and the hypotenuse has length \\(D(t)\\). The Pythagorean theorem tells us that \\[D(t)^2 = y(t)^2 + D_0^2\\ .\\] Note also a fact from trigonometry: \\[D(t=0) = D(t) \\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)\\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ D(t) = \\frac{D_0}{\\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)}\\] Step 1: Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(t\\): \\[\\partial_t \\left[\\strut D(t)^2\\right] = \\partial_t \\left[\\strut y(t)^2\\right] \\ \\] where we’ve used the fact that \\(D_0\\) is a constant and therefore \\(\\partial_t \\left[\\strut D_0^2 \\right] = 0\\). Step 2: Applying the chain rule to both sides gives \\[2\\, D(t)\\, \\partial_t D(t) = 2\\, y(t)\\ \\partial_t y(t)\\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\partial_t y(t) = \\frac{D(t)}{y(t)}\\,\\partial_t D(t)\\ .\\] Re-arranging terms and using the trigonometric fact \\(y(t) = D(t) \\sin\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)\\), we get \\[\\partial_t y(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\strut \\theta(t)\\right)}\\, \\partial_t D(t)\\ .\\] Step 3: We know from trigonometry that \\(D(t) = D_0/\\cos(\\theta(t))\\). Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(t\\) to get another form for \\(\\partial_t D(t)\\): \\[\\partial_t D(t) = D_0\\, \\partial_t \\frac{1}{\\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)} = D_0 \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)^2}\\, \\partial_t \\theta(t)\\] Step 4: Combining the results from Steps 2 and 3, we have \\[\\partial_t y(t) = \\frac{F}{m}\\,t = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)}D_0 \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)^2}\\, \\partial_t \\theta(t) \\\\= \\frac{D_0}{\\cos\\left(\\strut \\theta(t)\\right)^2} \\partial_t\\,\\theta(t) = D(t)^2\\, \\partial_t \\theta(t)\\] Again re-arranging, \\[\\frac{F D_0}{m}\\,t = \\left[{\\Large\\strut}\\frac{D_0}{\\cos\\left(\\strut\\theta(t)\\right)}\\right]^2 \\partial_t \\theta(t) = D(t)^2 \\partial_t \\theta(t)\\] so \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial_t\\,\\theta(t) = \\frac{F\\, D_0}{m D(t)^2}\\ t\\ . \\tag{31.3} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (31.3) does the motion accounting in terms of an angle \\(\\theta(t)\\). In contrast, Eq. (31.2) does the accounting in terms of a straight-line measurement \\(y(t)\\). In Eq. (31.2) the multiplier on \\(t\\) is the simple ratio of force to mass: \\(F/m\\). But in (31.3) the ratio appears differently, with \\(m\\, D(t)^2\\) in place of plain mass and \\(F D_0\\) in place of plain force. The term \\(m\\, D(t)^2\\) is called the moment of inertia of the probe with respect to the planet. The term \\(F\\ D_0\\) is the torque of the force with respect to the distance: the force times the distance from the planet measured perpendicularly to the force. The natural reason to use an angle for accounting is when you are working with rotational motion, such as understanding what happens when a kid jumps on or off a merry-go-round. Rather than using the ratio of force to mass, the angular acceleration \\(\\partial_{tt} \\theta(t)\\) will equal the ratio of torque to moment of inertia Example 31.3 Compute the moment of inertia of Zcalc::Blob1. It’s not enough to say, “compute the moment of inertia.” We also have to specify what is the reference location. We’ll first do the calculation around the center of mass \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) which we computed earlier as xbar and ybar: # moment of inertia box_set(10*((x - xbar)^2 + (y-ybar)^2)~ x + y, Zcalc::Blob1, dx = 0.01, sum=TRUE) ## [1] 76.67827 31.6 Exercises Exercise XX.XX: JJG2p2 Under Construction Content subject to revision.
