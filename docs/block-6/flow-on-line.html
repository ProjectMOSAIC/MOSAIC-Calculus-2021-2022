<a href="https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/MOSAIC-Calculus/blob/main/Block-6/B6-fixed-points.Rmd"><img src="www/icons/edit.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>The previous two chapters presented ideas relating to dynamical systems: state, state-space, dynamical function, flow, trajectory, “solution.” Now we turn to the some of the phenomena seen in dynamical systems, starting in the simplest way possible: dynamical systems with a single state variable. We’ll focus on <strong><em>fixed points</em></strong> and their <strong><em>stability</em></strong>, which can be understood qualitatively (although you need to distinguish between a positive and a negative slope). Then we’ll look at a technique we have encountered since Block 2: approximation of a function by a straight-line function. Such linear dynamics have a straightforward exponential “solution.”</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll look at an important example of how careful observation of fixed points and the way dynamics change when we modify a parameter in the dynamical functions provides an understanding of a ecological stability and instability and the consequences that result.</p>
<div id="dynamical-function-and-flow" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">49.1</span> Dynamical function and flow<a href="flow-on-line.html#dynamical-function-and-flow" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw how to draw a <strong><em>flow field</em></strong> in a two-dimensional state space, evaluating the dynamical functions and using the results to construct a vector. We can’t practically visualize <strong>both</strong> the flow and the shapes of the two dynamical functions in a single plot, which makes it harder to understand structures such as fixed points.</p>
<p>Happily, with a one-dimensional state space, we can easily show both the flow vectors <em>and</em> the single dynamical function at once.</p>
<p>For ease of reference, we’ll name the dynamical function for the rest of this section <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, so that the differential equation is <span class="math display">\[\partial_t x = f(x)\ .\]</span></p>
<p>The flow itself appears as the example in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro">49.1</a>. The state space is the number line and the flow vectors are, as usual arrows that point from place to place in the state space.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Because the state space can be drawn without using the vertical coordinate of the page, we can use that vertical coordinate to show something else: the dynamical function, as in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro2">49.2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The correspondence between the dynamical function and the flow field is easy to see in such a presentation. Where the output of the dynamical is large and positive (say, near <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>), the flow is in the positive direction and relatively fast, as shown by a long, right-pointing flow vector. When the output of the dynamical function is negative (around <span class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span>, for instance) the flow is in the negative direction: a left pointing arrow.</p>
<p>Near a zero crossing of the dynamical function, the flow arrows are negligibly short: the state velocity is very slow. Indeed, at the zero crossings, the state velocity is exactly zero. Such zero crossings are called <strong><em>fixed points</em></strong>: since the state velocity is zero, the state never moves!</p>
<p>We can see the dynamics near fixed points more closely by zooming in, as in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro3">49.3</a> which shows two of the system’s fixed points.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Notice in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro3">49.3</a> that the flow is slower the nearer the state is to the fixed point, but it is only exactly zero at the fixed point.</p>
<p>A calculus technique you will be familiar with from previous Blocks is zooming in a region that we want to examine in detail.</p>

<p>The short pieces of the dynamical function shown in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-zoom1">49.4</a>, are, like short pieces of any continuous function: almost exactly straight lines. For the left fixed point, the dynamical function is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \approx -2.804 (x + 3.055)\)</span> while for the right it is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \approx 5.065 (x + 1.586)\)</span>. In Section <a href="solve-DE.html#symbolic-solutions-ODE">48.3</a> we found symbolically the solutions for dynamical functions in this form.
For <span class="math inline">\(x_0\approx-3.055\)</span> the solution is <span class="math display">\[x(t) \approx (x_0 + 3.055)e^{-2.804 t} - 3.055\ ,\]</span> while for <span class="math inline">\(x_0\approx -1.586\)</span> the solution is <span class="math display">\[x(t) \approx (x_0 +1.586)\, e^{5.065 t} - 1.586\ .\]</span>
There is something fundamentally different about these two solutions. One of them is exponential decay toward the fixed point, while the other grows exponentially away from the fixed point. We call the dynamics near the fixed-point with exponential decay <strong><em>stable</em></strong> and the dynamics near fixed-point with exponential growth <strong><em>unstable</em></strong>.</p>

Graphics such as Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro2">49.2</a> let you see both the flow and the dynamical functions together in one place.</p>
<p>How about also showing trajectories? Unfortunately, the two-dimensional extent of a computer screen or a piece of paper make it hard to include still more information in an intelligible way. It would be nice to have a third dimension for the display.</p>
<p>Major Austin Davis developed such a display, using <strong><em>time</em></strong> as the third dimension. In the movie below, the state space is shown as a horizontal line, as before. The vertical axis shows the dynamical function as in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro2">49.2</a>. The dynamical function is shown in another way: as the hue and intensity of color, which lets you focus on the activity in the state space. This activity is shown by the moving gray triangles. Each triangle is placed on the phase line to mark an initial condition, then moves right or left according to the dynamics.</p>

<p>So long as two dynamical systems have similar fixed points with the same stability, their trajectories will be much the same.

<p>So long as two flows have similar fixed points with the same stability, their trajectories will be much the same. Consequently, studying the fixed points without worrying about the details of the dynamics gives a huge amount of information about the system.</p>
<p>For example, Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:many-trajs-1">49.6</a> shows a score of different time series following the solutions from a score of initial conditions. The long-term behaviors for all the time series is similar: they converge to one or another of the stable fixed points.</p>

<p>It’s worth pointing out a consequence of the mathematics of continuous functions: if a system with a continuous dynamical function has a region of state space with two different fixed points, there must be an unstable fixed point in between them.</p>

<p>You can see in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:many-trajs-1">49.6</a> that many of the solutions approach their final, equilibrium value in an exponential manner. This is particularly true for the solutions with initial conditions very near the stable fixed points. All these solutions are characterized quantitatively by the parameter <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in the exponential solution <span class="math inline">\(A e^{a t}\)</span>. (Remember, <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; 0\)</span> when there is exponential decay.)</p>
<p>Quantitative knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is helpful to understand the time scale of the exponential approach to stable fixed points. We can find a numerical value for <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for each fixed point by constructing a <strong><em>linear approximation</em></strong> to the dynamical function near each of the fixed points.</p>
<p>The procedure involves the same principles as introduced in Block 2 for constructing low-order polynomial approximations to functions, but here “low-order” means “first order.”</p>
<p>The analysis is done separately for each of the fixed points, so the first step is to find the fixed points, the values <span class="math inline">\(x^\star\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x^\star) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall from Block 2 the Taylor polynomial approximation to a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> centered on a point <span class="math inline">\(x^\star\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[f(x) \approx f(x^\star) + \partial_x f(x^\star) \left[x - x^\star\right]\]</span>
When <span class="math inline">\(x^\star\)</span> is a fixed point, <span class="math inline">\(f(x^\star) = 0\)</span> so the approximation is simply <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \approx \partial_x f(x^\star) \left[x - x^\star\right]\)</span>. Keep in mind that <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x^\star)\)</span> is the derivative function <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f\)</span> <strong>evaluated</strong> at the input <span class="math inline">\(x^\star\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x^star)\)</span> is simply a quantity, not a function. Indeed, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x^star)\)</span> is exactly the quantity <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in the exponential solution <span class="math inline">\(e^{a t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This process of constructing the linear approximation <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \approx a \left[x - x^\star\right]\)</span> is called <strong><em>linearization</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s return to the model of saving for retirement in Chapter <a href="diff-eq-intro.html#diff-eq-intro">47</a>:
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t V = r\, V + M\ .\]</span>
The state variable here is named <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The dynamical function is <span class="math display">\[g(V) = r\, V + M\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the interest rate (say, 3% per year which is <span class="math inline">\(r=0.03\)</span> per year) and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the monthly contribution. To keep the units consistent, we set the units of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to be years, of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to be 1/years, of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> to be dollars and of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be dollars-per-year. So a monthly contribution of $1000 would come to
<span class="math inline">\(M=12000\)</span> dollars-per-year.</p>
<p>Find the amount <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> that will result from 30 years of savings with an initial condition <span class="math inline">\(V_0 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step i) Find the fixed point. This is a value <span class="math inline">\(V^\star\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[r\, V^\star + M = 0\ \ \ \implies \ \ \ V^\star = -M/r\ .\]</span>
Step ii) Find the derivative of the dynamical function evaluated at the fixed point: Since <span class="math inline">\(g(V)\)</span> happens to be a straight-line function, we know the derivative is a constant. So <span class="math inline">\(b = \partial_x g(V^\star) = r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step iii) Translate the state variable into <span class="math inline">\(y = V - V^\star\)</span>. The dynamics in terms of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t y = b y\)</span>, which has an exponential solution <span class="math inline">\(y = A e^{bt}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step iv) <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the initial condition in terms of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This will be <span class="math inline">\(y_0 = V_0 - V^\star\)</span>. Since we stated that <span class="math inline">\(V_0 = 0\)</span> (no savings at the start), <span class="math inline">\(y_0 = -V^\star\)</span> and the solution is <span class="math display">\[y(t) = -V^\star e^{bt} = \frac{M}{r} e^{rt}\ .\]</span></p>
<p>Step v) Translate the solution in step (iv) back into terms of <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(y(t) = V(t) - V^\star\)</span>, this will be <span class="math inline">\(V(t) = y(t) + V^\star\)</span> or, <span class="math display">\[V(t) = \frac{M}{r} e^{r t} + V^\star = \frac{M}{r} \left[ e^{r t} - 1\right]\ .\]</span>

<p>A broad, pressing, social concern goes under the name <strong><em>sustainability</em></strong>. Is it sustainable to burn fossil fuels at steady historical levels, let alone at the increasing rate seen since over the last century? Climate scientists answer resoundingly with a no. Is it sustainable to increase food production to the levels needed for developing economies to approach the sort of consumption seen in rich economies?</p>
<p>Dynamical systems are highly relevant to the questions surrounding sustainability. If the economy is near a stable fixed point, then it is sustainable; the trajectory will bring the state of the economy toward the fixed point. On the other hand, if the economy is near an unstable fixed point, we can expect exponential change.</p>
<p>If such exponential changes are not seen, does that mean we’re not near an unstable fixed point? One of the terms used to mark the possibility that a stable system can quickly turn unstable is <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point">tipping point</a></em></strong>, defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The point at which a series of small changes or incidents becomes significant enough to cause a larger, more important change.</em> Source: New Oxford American Dictionary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mathematics of tipping points is not at all the same as exponential growth. Certainly, in exponential growth one sees a relatively slow rate of change increase to a large rate of change, a situation described by journalists as “sky-rocketing” or “explosive” or, literally, “exponential.” As you’ve seen, exponential growth is a phenomenon seen in linear dynamical systems; there is no special point at which the dynamics changes.</p>
<p>There is actually an area of mathematical theory called <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory">catastrophe theory</a></em></strong>. We’ll use a famous example to show how catastrophes or tipping points are modeled mathematically.</p>
<p>The example comes from a 1977 article in <em>Nature</em>, one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals. The article, by Robert May, is entitled “Thresholds and breakpoints in ecosystems with a multiplicity of stable states.” The words “thresholds” and “breakpoints” have not been encountered yet in this book, but “multiplicity of stable states” should bring to mind the sort of dynamics seen in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:phase-line-intro2">49.2</a>.</p>
<p>The setting for the catastrophe is an otherwise bucolic scene, livestock grazing on a pasture. A pasture is a kind of factory for producing vegetable biomass; the grazing is the consumption of the biomass produced.</p>
<p>As a model for the production of biomass, denoted <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for “vegetation,” we’ll use
<span class="math display">\[\partial_t v = r v \left(1 - \frac{v}{K}\right)\]</span>
which, as we’ve seen, has an unstable fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(v_1^\star=0\)</span> and a stable fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(v_2^\star=K\)</span>. Physically, the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(v_1^\star\)</span> corresponds to a bare field, without any vegetation. It’s unstable because any small disturbance in the form of a stray seed landing in the dirt can lead to germination and the rapid growth of vegetation as seeds from the germinated plant spread across the field. Once the field is covered in vegetation, the growth can be exponentially rapid at first but then runs into limited resources: there is only so much sunlight that falls on the field, and the growing vegetation will eventually consume the soil nutrients and water.</p>
<p>This biomass production model corresponds to a sustainable system. Once the biomass level is at <span class="math inline">\(v_2^\star\)</span> it will stay there.</p>
<p>But biomass production is not the only thing going on in the pasture. The grazing animals—let’s imagine they are cows—are consuming the grass. To start very simply, suppose that each cow consumes amount <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> of biomass each day. If there are <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> cows, the total consumption is <span class="math inline">\(H C\)</span> per day. This modifies the dynamics to a slightly new form <span class="math display">\[\partial_t v = r \,v(1-\frac{v}{K}) - HC\]</span>. The original, ungrazed dynamics are compared with the grazed dynamics in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:grazing-comparison">49.7</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>With grazing, the <strong><em>net</em></strong> growth of biomass is reduced due to the removal of the consumed biomass by the cows’ consumption. For a moderate herd size, there is still a stable fixed point, but it is at a lower level of biomass than would be seen in the ungrazed field. But if the herd size is too large, the ecosystem completely collapses.</p>
<p>This is an example of a tipping point or catastrophe. For moderate herd sizes, there remains a stable fixed point. A farmer might be tempted to add another cow to the pasture, and that’s sustainable: there is still a stable fixed point. Indeed, the movement of the stable fixed point might not even be noticed. But add even one cow too many and the fixed point entirely disappears. Still, herd management can fix the problem; take away the cow that tipped the pasture and the fixed point will return.</p>
<div class="mathintheworld">
<p>We’ve often referred to the <strong><em>modeling cycle</em></strong>, using the results of a model to suggest possible improvements in the model.</p>
<p>Missing from the pasture model is a simple idea of how cows eat. If there is very little biomass, the cows can’t continue to eat their fill. Will the reduction in consumption per cow preserve the stable fixed point?</p>
<p>In his <em>Nature</em> article, May modeled the consumption rate by a single cow with the functional form <span class="math display">\[C(v) \equiv \frac{\beta v^2}{v_0 - v^2}\]</span> which is graphed for <span class="math inline">\(\beta=0.1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_0 = 3\)</span> in Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:cow-consumption">49.8</a></p>

<p>You can recognize this as a form of sigmoid. When the amount of vegetation is very large, a cow will eat her fill. That’s the saturation of the sigmoid.

<p>We can start the story with 3 cows in the pasture. Vegetation growth is more than sufficient to provide for these cows. You can see this from the stable fixed point at about 9 tons of biomass, which is more than enough to reach saturation of the sigmoidal consumption function.</p>
<p>The farmer decides to increase the herd to 5 cows. Nothing much happens. The stable fixed point is at about 8 tons of biomass, entirely adequate to keep the cows well fed in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Can the pasture be sustainable with 7 cows? The stable fixed point remains, now at about 6.5 tons at biomass. The cows are still sustainably well fed.</p>
<p>You can see in the 7-cow dynamics a hint of what of what might go wrong. There is a new, unstable fixed point at about 3 tons of biomass. If the pasture ever happened transiently to fall below 3 tons—say due to a summer frost followed by a return to normal weather—the vegetation biomass will head toward the new stable fixed point at 0.5 tons of biomass. At this level, the cows are eating only about one-quarter their normal amount and we can fairly say that the ecosystem has collapsed. But until such a disaster happens, the farmer will see only a sustainable level of biomass with cows well fed.</p>
<p>It is only we, who have a mathematical model of the situation, who can anticipate the potential problems.</p>
<p>Since things are fine with 7 cows in the field, the farmer lets an eighth cow join the herd. That’s the tipping point. The happy herd fixed point at 6.5 tons of biomass has disappeared, and the ecosystem collapses, even without a weather disaster.</p>
<p>Removing the eighth cow from the pasture will not fix the situation. With seven or even six cows in the pasture, the system won’t be able to grow out of the stable fixed point with 0.5 tons of biomass. Reducing the herd size to five will remove that 0.5 ton fixed point, but the grass will grow back very slowly; the dynamics give positive growth, but very close to zero.</p>
<p>Avoiding such catastrophes is a major motivation for mathematical modeling.</p>

<p>There are two obvious shortcomings of the model <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t G(t) = C\)</span>.

<p>Figure <a href="flow-on-line.html#fig:cow-consumption">49.8</a> shows a model of a cow’s consumption of vegetation as a sigmoidal function of the amount of vegetation. In addition to the mathematics of the function, it’s helpful to be able to translate the shape of the function into terms that make sense in the <strong>context</strong> of the model.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> At what level of available biomass is the cow most hungry at the end of the day? (Hint: Think about how you would measure how hungry a cow is at the end of the day.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">2 tons<span class="mcanswer">Correct. The consumption function is steepest here, meaning that if more grass were available the cow would eat the biggest proportion of it.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">5 tons<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ The level of hunger can be measured by the slope of the consumption curve. If a cow would eat a lot more if the biomass were available, she must be hungry.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">10 tons<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ The level of hunger can be measured by the slope of the consumption curve. If a cow would eat a lot more if the biomass were available, she must be hungry.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">15 tons<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ Even if more grass were available, the cow wouldn’t each much of it. So, the cow is not very hungry.</span></span></li>

<p>A debit card is a way to make withdrawals from a bank account. Funds in the account earn interest. In the economic environment of 2021, the interest rate is practically zero. But to make it possible to see the growth on a graph, we will stipulate it to be 4% per year. But if the account is in debt, then the debt grows at a much faster rate, perhaps 15% per year.</p>
<p>Suppose the amount in the bank account is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> (in dollars) and time is <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (in years). If <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is positive, you are earning interest. If negative, you are in debt and the debt will grow.</p>

<p>You and your older cousin are on a road trip. She rented a car that has not only “cruise control” (a technology from the 1970s that holds a constant speed without driver intervention) but also “car following,” that keeps the car a set distance <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> behind the car in front. Your cousin, knowing that you are a CalcZ student, asks you how the “car following” system works.</p>
<p>First, define some terms. You tell your cousin to denote the current, instantaneous distance from the car ahead as <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. You point out that when <span class="math inline">\(\xi - D &gt; 0\)</span>, you’re a greater distance than <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> from the car ahead and therefore the velocity should be increased so you catch up. On the other hand, when you’re too close (<span class="math inline">\(\xi &lt; D\)</span>) you should decrease your velocity. The car-following system automates this, the relationship being <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t \xi = b (\xi - D)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Your cousin has never encountered a name like <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> so you decide to simplify. “Let <span class="math inline">\(x = \xi - D\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is positive if you are too far behind, zero when you’re at the right distance, and negative if you are too far ahead.” Conveniently <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t x = \partial_t \xi\)</span>, so you can write down the automatic relationship in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:
<span class="math inline">\(\partial_t x = b x\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> a positive number, such as 1.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> Where is the fixed point of the dynamics <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = b x\)</span>?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(x=D\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ No, it should be <span class="math inline">\(\xi=D\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span><span class="mcanswer">Correct. </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\xi = 0\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ This corresponds to zero distance between you and the car in front of you. Not what we want!</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">There’s no fixed point.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ </span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> Is the fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = b x\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; 0\)</span>) stable?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice">Yes, that’s why we can leave it to the automatic system.<span class="mcanswer">︎✘ True, we would want the automatic system to show stable fixed point behavior, but that’s not what’s happening here.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">No, the solution grows exponentially as <span class="math inline">\(e^{bt}\)</span>.<span class="mcanswer">Excellent! </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice">Yes, the solution decays exponentially as <span class="math inline">\(e^{bt}\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ But since <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; 0\)</span>, this wouldn’t be exponential decay but growth.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Something’s wrong with the system you’ve sketched out. You want a stable following distance, doing the right thing if the car ahead speeds up or slows down, but your system is unstable.</p>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> Which of the following rules will have a stable fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = -b x\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; 0\)</span>)<span class="mcanswer">Nice! </span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = b^2 x\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ The coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is still positive, so this system is unstable.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = b x^2\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ This system is stable for disturbances that make <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; 0\)</span>, but <strong>unstable</strong> for disturbances that make <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; 0\)</span>.</span></span><br />
</li>
<li><span class="Zchoice"><span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = 0 x\)</span><span class="mcanswer">︎✘ In this system, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> doesn’t change.</span></span></li>
</ol>
The word “feedback” is used to describe systems where the change in the state is a function of the state. “Negative feedback” is when the change is negative when the state is positive, as in <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = -b\, x\)</span>. Negative feedback is desirable when you want to keep things stable. “Positive feedback” is when the change is the same sign as the state, as in <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\, x = b\, x\)</span> and makes things unstable.
