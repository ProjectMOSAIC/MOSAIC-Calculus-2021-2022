Nowadays, they are used to describe all sorts of physical systems, from oscillations in electrical circuits to the ecology of interacting species, to the spread of contagious disease. As examples of dynamical systems, consider a ball thrown thrown through the air or a rocket being launched to deploy a satellite. At each instant of time, a ball has a position—a point in \\(x,y,z\\) space—and a velocity \\(\\partial_t x\\), \\(\\partial_t y\\), and \\(\\partial_t z\\). These six quantities, and perhaps others like spin, constitute the instantaneous state of the ball. Rockets have additional components of state, for example the mass of the fuel remaining. The “dynamical” in “dynamical systems” refers to the change in state. For the ball, the state changes under the influence of mechanisms such as gravity and air resistance. The mathematical representation of a dynamical system codifies how the state changes as a function of the instantaneous state. For example, if the instantaneous state is a single quantity called \\(x\\), the instantaneous change in state is the derivative of that quantity: \\(\\partial_t x\\). To say that \\(x\\) changes in time is to say that \\(x\\) is a function of time: \\(x(t)\\). When we write \\(x\\), we mean \\(x()\\) evaluated at an instant. When we write \\(\\partial_t x\\), we mean “the derivative of \\(x(t)\\) with respect to time” evaluated at the same instant as for \\(x\\). The dynamical system describing the motion of \\(x\\) is written in the form of a differential equation, like this: \\[\\partial_t x = f(x)\\ .\\] Notice that the function \\(f()\\) is directly a function of \\(x\\), not \\(t\\). This is very different from the situation we studied in Block 3, where we might have written \\(\\partial_t y = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} t\\right)\\) and assigned you the challenge of finding the function \\(y(t)\\) by anti-differentiation. (The answer to the anti-differentiation problem, of course, is \\(y(t) = \\frac{P}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{P} t\\right) + C\\).) It is essential that you train yourself to distinguish two very different statements anti-differentiation problems like \\(\\partial_\\color{blue}{t} y = g(\\color{blue}{t})\\), which has \\(t\\) as both the with-respect-to variable and as the argument to the function \\(g()\\). and dynamical systems like \\[\\partial_\\color{blue}{t} \\color{magenta}{y} = g(\\color{magenta}{y})\\ .\\] This is one place where Leibniz’s notation for derivatives can be useful: \\[\\underbrace{\\frac{d\\color{magenta}{y}}{d\\color{blue}{t}} = g(\\color{blue}{t})}_{\\text{as in antidifferentiation}}\\ \\ \\ \\text{versus}\\ \\ \\ \\underbrace{\\frac{d\\color{magenta}{y}}{d\\color{blue}{t}} = g(\\color{magenta}{y})}_{\\text{dynamical system}}\\] Dynamical systems with multiple state quantities are written mathematically as sets of differential equations, for instance: \\[\\partial_t y = g(y, z)\\\\ \\partial_t z = h(y, z)\\] We typically use the word system rather than “set,” so a dynamical system is represented by a system of differential equations. Example 47.1 \\(\\ \\) Let’s illustrate the idea of a dynamical system with a children’s game: “Chutes and Ladders”. Since hardly any children have studied calculus, the game isn’t presented as differential equations, but as a simple board and the rules for the movement along the board. A player’s state in this game is shown by the position of a token, but we’ll define the state to be the number of the square that the player’s token is on. In Chutes and Ladders the state is one of the integers from 1 to 100. In contrast, the dynamical systems that we’ll study with calculus have a state that is a point on the number line, or in the coordinate plane, or higher-dimensional space. Our calculus dynamical system describe the change of state using derivatives with respect to time, whereas in chutes and ladders the the state jumps from one value to the next value. The game board displays not only the set of possible states but also the rule for changing state jumping from one state to another. In the real game, players roll a die to determine how many steps to take to the next state. But we’ll play a simpler game: Just move one step forward on each turn, except … from place to place there are ladders that connect two squares. When the state reaches a square holding the foot of a ladder, the state is swept up to the higher-numbered square at the top of the ladder. Similarly, there are chutes. These work much like the ladders but carry the state from a higher-numbered square to a lower-numbered square. The small drawings on the board are not actually part of the action of the game. Rather, they represent the idea that good deeds lead the player to progress, while wrong-doing produces regression. Thus, the productive gardener in square 1 is rewarded by being moved upward to the harvest in square 38. In square 64 a brat is pulling on his sister’s braids. This misdeed results in punishment: he is moved back to square 60. Our dice-free version of Chutes and Ladders is an example of a discrete-time, discrete-state dynamical system. Since there is no randomness involved, the movement of the state is deterministic. (With dice, the movement would be stochastic.) The differential equations of a dynamical system correspond to a continuous-time, continuous-space system. This continuity is the reason we need derivatives to describe the motion of the state. The movement in the systems we’ll explore is also deterministic. (In Chapter 55 we’ll encounter briefly some instances of stochastic systems.) 47.2 State The mathematical language of differential equations and dynamical systems is able to describe a stunning range of systems, for example: physics swing of a pendulum bobbing of a mass hanging from a spring. a rocket shooting up from the launch pad commerce investment growth growth in equity in a house as a mortgage is paid up. (“Equity” is the amount of the value of the house that belongs to you.) biology growth of animal populations, including predator and prey. spread of an infectious disease growth of an organism or a crop. All these systems involve a state that describes the configuration of the system at a given instant in time. For the growth of a crop, the state would be, say, the amount of biomass per unit area. For the spread of infectious disease, the state would be the fraction of people who are infectious and the fraction who are susceptible to infection. “State” in this sense is used in the sense of “the state of affairs,” or “his mental state,” or “the state of their finances.” Since we’re interested in how the state changes over time, sometimes we refer to it as the dynamical state. One of the things you learn when you study a field such as physics or epidemiology or engineering is what constitutes a useful description of the dynamical state for different situations. In the crop and infectious disease examples above, the state mentioned is a strong simplification of reality: a model. Often, the modeling cycle leads the modeler to include more components to the state. For instance, some models of crop growth include the density of crop-eating insects. For infectious disease, a model might include the fraction of people who are incubating the disease but not yet contagious. Consider the relatively simple physical system of a pendulum, swinging back and forth under the influence of gravity. In physics, you learn the essential dynamical elements of the pendulum system: the current angle the pendulum makes to the vertical, and the rate at which that angle changes. There are also fixed elements of the system, for instance the length of the pendulum’s rod and the local gravitational acceleration. Although such fixed characteristics may be important in describing the system, they are not elements of the dynamical state. Instead, they might appear as parameters in the functions on the right-hand side of the differential equations. To be complete, the dynamical state of a system has to include all those changing aspects of the system that allow you to calculate from the state at this instant what the state will be at the next instant. For example, the angle of the pendulum at an instant tells you a lot about what the angle will be at the next instant, but not everything. You also need to know which way the pendulum is swinging and how fast. Figuring out what constitutes the dynamical state requires knowledge of the mechanics of the system, e.g. the action of gravity, the constraint imposed by the pivot of the pendulum. You get that knowledge by studying the relevant field: electrical engineering, economics, epidemiology, etc. You also learn what aspects of the system are fixed or change slowly enough that they can be considered fixed. (Sometimes you find out that something your intuition tells you is important to the dynamics is, in fact, not. An example is the mass of the pendulum.) 47.3 State space The state of a dynamical system tells you the configuration of the system at any instant in time. It’s appropriate to think about the instantaneous state as a single point in a state space, a coordinate system with an axis for each component of state. As the system configuration changes with time—say, the pendulum loses velocity as it swings to the left—the instantaneous state moves along a path in the state space. Such a path is called a trajectory of the dynamical system. In this book, we will work almost exclusively with systems that have a one- or two-dimensional state. Consequently, the state space will be either the number line or the coordinate plane. The methods you learn will be broadly applicable to systems with higher-dimensional state. For the deterministic dynamical systems we will be working with, a basic principle is that a trajectory can never cross itself. This can be demonstrated by contradiction. Suppose a trajectory did cross itself. This would mean that the motion from the crossing point couple possibly go in either of two directions; the state might follow one branch of the cross or the other. Such a system would not be deterministic. Determinism implies that from each point in state space the flow goes only in one direction. The dimension of the state space is the same as the number of components of the state; one axis of state space for every component of the state. has important implications for the type of motion that can exist. If the state space is one-dimensional, the state as a function of time must be monotonic. Otherwise, the trajectory would cross itself, which is not permitted. A state space that is two- or higher-dimensional can support motion that oscillates back and forth. Such a trajectory does not cross itself, instead it goes round and round in a spiral or a closed loop. For many decades, it was assumed that all dynamical systems produce either monotonic behavior or spiral or loop behavior. In the 1960s, scientists working on a highly simplified model of the atmosphere discovered numerically that there is a third type of behavior, the irregular and practically unpredictable behavior called chaos. To display chaos, the state space of the system must have at least three elements. That calculus is the language of change can be seen in the words used in this section. For instance, instantaneous, continuous, and monotonic are all words introduced in Block 1 of this book. What does it take to describe the dynamical state of an epidemic? News reports of the COVID pandemic usually focus on the number of new cases each day and the fraction of the population that has been vaccinated. But this is not adequate, even for a simple description of the dynamics. From a history of new-case counts over time (e.g. Figure 47.1) you can see that the number of new cases waxes and wanes. Knowing that the number of cases today is, say, 100 thousand doesn’t tell you what the number of cases will be in two weeks: 100 thousand is encountered both on the way up and on the way down. Figure 47.1: COVID-19 new-case counts in the US over the first two years of the pandemic. Source: [New York Times] 47.4 Dynamics The dynamics of a system is a description of how the individual components of the state change as a function of the entire set of components of the state. At any instant in time, the state is a set of quantities. We’ll use \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) for the purpose of illustration, although most of our work in this introduction will be with systems that have just one or two state variables. The differential equations describing the \\(x, y, z\\) system have a particular form: \\[\\partial_t x(t) = f(x(t), y(t), z(t))\\ \\, \\\\ \\partial_t y(t) = g(x(t), y(t), z(t))\\ \\, \\\\ \\partial_t z(t) = h(x(t), y(t), z(t))\\ .\\] The way these equations are written is This is practically impossible to read: the expression \\((t)\\) is repeated 12 times! It take concentration to look beyond the \\((t)\\) to see the overall structure of the equations. In order to avoid this problem of not seeing the forest for the \\((t)\\)s, the convention is to omit the \\((t)\\): \\[\\partial_t x = f(x, y, z)\\\\ \\partial_t y = g(x, y, z)\\\\ \\partial_t z = h(x, y, z)\\] This leaves it to the reader to remember that \\(x\\) is really \\(x(t)\\) and so on. This more concise way of writing the differential equations makes it easier to describe how to interpret the equations. Formally, \\(\\partial_t x\\) is a function, the derivative of the function \\(x(t)\\) with respect to time. But try to put this highly literal interpretation on a back burner. Think of the expression \\(\\partial_t x =\\) as meaning, “the way the \\(x\\)-component of state changes in time is described by ….” We need three differential equations because there are three components of state in the \\(x,y,z\\) system, and we need to describe for each component the way that component changes. On the right side of each equation is a function that takes the state quantities as inputs. Each individual equation can be interpreted as completing the elliptical (that is, …) sentence in the previous paragraph, so that the whole equation reads like, “The way the \\(x\\)-component of state changes at any instant in time is specified by the function \\(h()\\) evaluated at the instantaneous state.” These functions are called dynamical functions since they give the rules for the dynamics. Remember that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are state variables, so they are all functions of time. At any instant in time, the values \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) have a specific value. Thus, at any instant in time, evaluating the functions \\(f(x, y, z)\\), \\(g(x, y, z)\\), and \\(h(x, y, z)\\) at the current state produces a specific, scalar value. If we wanted to make this perfectly explicit, we could write \\(g_x(x(t), y(t), z(t))\\), which makes it clear that the output of \\(g_x()\\) is a function of time. Mathematically, a dynamical system consists of two things: The state variables, which is a set of quantities that vary in time. The dynamics, which is the set of dynamical functions, one function for each of the state variables. A simple example is the dynamics of retirement-account interest. In a retirement account, you put aside money—this is called “contributing”—each month. The value \\(V(t)\\) of the account accumulates over time, both due to new monthly deposits and to the interest \\(r\\) earned on the current account value. If you are setting aside \\(M\\) dollars per month, the dynamics are: \\[\\partial_t V = r V + M\\ .\\] The left-hand side of this equation is boilerplate for “the way the \\(V\\) component of state changes is described by the dynamical function \\(rV + M\\).” This is a function of \\(V\\) with parameters \\(r\\) and \\(M\\). In this example, there’s just the one state variable \\(V\\), so the dynamical function has only one argument: \\(V\\). Remember that the dynamical function is something that the modeler constructs from her knowledge of the system. To model the dynamics of a pendulum requires some knowledge of physics. Without getting involved with the physics, we note that the oscillatory nature of pendulum movement means that there must be at least two state variables. A physicist learns that a good way to describe the motion uses these two quantities: the angle \\(\\theta(t)\\) of the pendulum rod with respect to the vertical and the angular velocity \\(v(t)\\) telling how the velocity changes with time. Since there are two state variables, there must be two dynamical functions. For a pendulum, one of the functions, the one for \\(\\partial_t v\\) comes from applying Newton’s Second Law: \\(F = m a\\). (Remember that \\(\\partial_t v\\) is an acceleration.) So one of the differential equations is \\[\\partial_t v = f(\\theta, v) \\equiv - \\sin(\\theta)\\] The other equation comes from the definition that the derivative of the position \\(\\theta\\) is the velocity. \\[\\partial_t \\theta = g(\\theta, v) \\equiv v\\\\ \\] Why did you bother to define a state variable \\(v\\) when it is, by definition, exactly the same as \\(\\partial_t \\theta(t)\\)? Even though the dynamical equation \\(\\partial_t \\theta(t) = v\\) is a calculus tautology, we need always to be explicit about what are the two quantities in the dynamical state. The \\(\\partial_t \\theta\\) differential equation comes for free from basic calculus concepts. The second equation is about the physics, that is, the relationship between forces and acceleration. There is a style of writing dynamics equations that discards such tautologies. For example, the pendulum dynamics are often written \\[\\partial_{tt} \\theta(t) = - \\sin(\\theta)\\ .\\] This sort of equation, containing a second-order derivative, is called a second-order differential equation. In contrast, the equations for the pendulum presented above are called firstIt’s exactly equivalent to the pair of first-order differential equations*** because each involves a first-order derivative, specifically, \\(\\partial_t \\theta(t)\\) and \\(\\partial v_\\theta(t)\\). We’ll return to this second-order style in Chapter 54 since it is often encountered in physics and engineering. For now, we are avoiding the second-order style because it obscures the fact that there are two state variables: \\(\\theta(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\). Example 47.2 \\(\\ \\) Consider the population of two interacting species, say rabbits and foxes. As you know, the relationship between rabbits and foxes is rather unhappy from the rabbits’ point of view even if it is fulfilling for the foxes. Many people assume that such populations are more or less fixed: that the rabbits are in a steady balance with the foxes. In fact, as any gardener can tell you, some years there are lots of rabbits and others not: an oscillation. Just from this fact, we know that the dynamical state must have at least two components. In a simple, but informative, model, the two components of the dynamical state are \\(r(t)\\) and \\(f(t)\\), the population of rabbits and foxes respectively. In the absence of foxes, the dynamics of rabbits are exponential growth; each successive generation is larger than the previous one. This can be described by a dynamical equation \\(\\partial_t r(t) = \\alpha r(t)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a fixed quantity that describes rabbit fecundity. Similarly, in the absence of food (rabbits are fox food), the foxes will starve or emigrate, so the dynamical equation for foxes is very similar \\(\\partial_t f(t) = - \\gamma f(t)\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is a fixed quantity that indicates the rate at which foxes die or emigrate. Of course, in real ecosystems there are many other quantities that change and that are relevant. For instance, foxes eat not only rabbits, but birds and frogs and earthworms and berries. And the diet of rabbits eat weeds and grass (which is generally in plentiful supply), but also the gardener’s flowers and carrots (and other vegetables). Growth in the rabbit population leads to decrease in available flowers and vegetables, which in turn leads to slower growth (or even population decline) for rabbits. In the spirit of illustrating dynamics, we’ll leave out these important complexities and imagine that the state consists of just two numbers: how many rabbits there are and how many foxes. The dynamics therefore involve two equations, one for \\(\\partial_t r\\) and one for \\(\\partial_t f\\), usually written: \\[\\partial_t r = \\alpha\\, r - \\beta\\, f r\\\\ \\partial_t f = \\delta\\, r f - \\gamma\\, f\\] The quantities \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\delta\\) are parameters quantify the biology of the system: the reproduction rate of rabbits, the need of foxes for food (rabbits) in order to reproduce, the hunting success of foxes, and the death or emigration of foxes in response to a shortage of food. How are you supposed to know that \\(r\\) and \\(f\\) are state variables while quantities like \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are parameters? Because there is a differential equation involving \\(\\partial_t r\\) and \\(\\partial_t f\\), while no differential equation has been given describing \\(\\partial_t \\beta\\) or \\(\\partial_t \\alpha\\). Coming up with this description of dynamics requires knowing something about rabbits and foxes. The particular forms used, for instance the interaction term \\(r f\\), come from modeling experience. The interaction term is well named because it is about the literal, biological interaction of foxes and rabbits. 47.5 State space and flow field A helpful representation of dynamics for the purpose of developing intuition is to represent the instantaneous state as a point in a graphical frame and the dynamics as a field of vectors showing how, for each possible state, the state changes. For instance, in the Rabbit-Fox dynamics, the state is the pair \\((r, f)\\) and the state space is the coordinate plane spanned by \\(r\\) and \\(f\\). The present state of the system might be any point in the state space. But once we know the present state, the dynamical functions evaluated at the present state tell us how the state changes over a small increment in time. The step over a small increment of time can be represented by a vector. Let’s illustrate with the Rabbit-Fox system, whose dynamical equations are given above. The dynamical functions take a position in state space as input. Each of the functions returns a scalar. To make a plot, we need numerical values for all the parameters in those equations. The vector field corresponding to the dynamics is called a flow, as if it were a pool of swirling water. Figure 47.2 shows the flow of the rabbit/fox system. Figure 47.2: The dynamics of the rabbit/fox system shown as a vector field over the state space. The parameters have been set, for the purpose of illustration, to \\(\\alpha = 2/3\\), \\(\\beta = 4/3\\), \\(\\gamma = 1\\), and \\(\\delta = 1\\). Staying with the analogy to a pool of swirling water or the currents in a river, you can place a lightweight marker such as a leaf at some point in the flow and follow its path over time. This path—position in state space as a function of time—is called the trajectory of the flow. There are many possible trajectories, depending on where you place the leaf. In Chapter 33 we considered the path followed by a robot arm. In that chapter, we separated out the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-components of the arm’s position over time, calling them functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\). Analogously, the the decomposition of a trajectory from an initial condition in the flow—this would be \\(r(t)\\) and \\(f(t)\\) for the rabbit/fox system—gives us the solution to the differential equation. Each component of the solution is called a time series and is often plotted as a function of time, for instance \\(r(t)\\) versus \\(t\\). From the flow field, you can approximate the trajectory that will be followed from any initial condition. Starting from the initial condition, just follow the flow. You already have some practice following a flow from your study of the gradient ascent method of optimization described in Chapter 23. At the argmax, the gradient is nil. Thus, the gradient ascent method stops at the argmax. We’ll see an analogous behavior in dynamical systems: any place where the flow is nil is a potential resting point for the state, called a fixed point. Example 47.3 \\(\\ \\) Let’s return to the pendulum and examine its flow field. We’ll modify the equations just a little bit to include air resistance in the model. Air resistance is a force, so we know it will appear in the \\(\\partial_t v_\\theta(t)\\) equation. A common model for air resistance has it proportional in size to the square of the velocity and with a direction that is the opposite of the velocity. In a differential equation, the model of air resistance can be written as \\(- \\alpha\\, L\\, \\text{sign}(v(t))\\ v(t)^2\\), where \\(\\text{sign}()\\) is a piecewise function that has the value \\(+1\\) when the argument is positive and \\(-1\\) when the argument is negative. \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum. \\[\\partial_t \\theta = v_\\theta\\\\ \\partial_t v_\\theta = - \\sin(\\theta) - \\alpha\\,L\\, \\text{sign}(v)\\ v^2\\] Note that we’ve dropped the \\((t)\\) in \\(\\theta(t)\\) and in \\(v_\\theta(t)\\). Whenever you have a state variable, you know that it’s a function of time and so the explicit \\((t)\\) is often omitted for the sake of conciseness. Figure 47.3 shows the flow field of the pendulum. Also shown is a trajectory and the two time series corresponding to that trajectory. Figure 47.3: The flow field of a pendulum with air resistance. From the initial condition (marked by \\(\\color{red}{\\text{x}}\\)), a trajectory is sketched out for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 20\\). The individual components of that trajectory are graphed as time series. The pendulum was started out by lifting it to an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) and giving it an initial upward velocity. The bob swings up for a bit before being reversed by gravity and swinging toward \\(\\theta = 0\\) and beyond. Due to air resistance, the amplitude of swinging decreases over time. The flow of a dynamical system tells how different points in state space are connected. Because movement of the state is continuous in time and the state space itself is continuous, the connections cannot be stated in the form “this point goes to that point.” Instead, as has been the case all along in calculus, we describe the movement in terms of a “velocity” vector. Each dynamical function specifies one component of the “velocity” vector, taken together they tell the direction and speed of movement of the state at each instant in time. Perhaps it would be better to use the term state velocity instead of “velocity.” In physics and most aspects of everyday life, “velocity” refers to the rate of change of physical position of an object. Similarly, the state velocity tells the rate of change of the position of the state. It’s a useful visualization technique to think of the state as an object skating around the state space in a manner directed by the dynamical functions. But the state space almost always includes components other than physical position. For instance, in the rabbit/fox model, the state says nothing about where individual rabbits and foxes are located in their environment; it’s all about the density of animals in a region. In physics, often the state space consists of position in physical state as well as the physical velocity in physical space. For instance, the state might consist of the three \\(x, y, z\\) components of physical position as well as the three \\(v_x, v_y, v_z\\) components of physical velocity. Altogether, that’s a six-dimensional state space. The state velocity also has six components. Three of those components will be the “velocity of the velocity,” that is, the direction and speed with which the physical velocity is changing. Example 47.4 \\(\\ \\) Returning to the Chutes and Ladders game used as an example near the start of this chapter … The state in chutes and ladders is one of the hundred numbers 1, 2, \\(\\ldots\\), 100. This is a discrete state space. Therefore, we can describe the “flow” in a very concrete way: how each state is directly connected to another. Figure 47.4 shows these connections. There is no velocity involved because there is no infinitesimal movement of state. For instance, state 47 connects directly to state 26. Figure 47.4: The “flow” connecting the discrete states in the dice-free Chutes and Ladders game. Source: Maj. Austin Davis In the no-dice game, the state follows the arrows. Looking carefully at Figure 47.4, you can see that each state has a forward connection to at most one state. This is the hallmark of determinism. In the children’s game, the play is not deterministic because a die is used to indicate which state follows from each other state. A die has six faces with the six numbers 1 to 6. So, each state is connected to six other states in the forward direction. Which of the six is to be followed depends on the number that comes up on the die. Multiple forward connections is the hallmark of stochastic (random) dynamics. Straightforward examination of the flow often tells you a lot about the big picture of the system. In dice-free Chutes and Ladders, The 100 states are divided into three isolated islands. State 1 is part of the island in the lower right corner of Figure 47.4. Follow the arrows starting from any place on that island and you will eventually reach state 84. And state 84 is part of a cycle \\(84 \\rightarrow 85 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow 28 \\rightarrow 84 \\rightarrow \\cdots\\). Once you are on that cycle, you never get off. We’ll see such cycles in continuous-time dynamical systems as well. 47.6 Exercises D-93XWJ: Given a flow field in one or two dimensions, draw a plausible trajectory G-MC8XJ: Explain why determinism rules out two different trajectories passing through any single point in state space.

The text mentions a cycle involving state 84. Write down all the other cycles in the flow. The goal of the game is to get to state 100. From how many initial states (other than 100) will the flow eventually lead to state 100. The only terminal endpoint for the flow on the state island shown in the upper left corner of the diagram is state 100. Explain why, in the dice-free game, there cannot possibly be another terminal endpoint for the flow on that state island.

For instance, in \\[\\partial_t x = x\\,(1-x)\\] left-hand side of the equation involves the function \\(x(t)\\). The equation dictates that whatever \\(x(t)\\) might be, it has to be such that \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) is exactly equal to the function \\(x(t)\\,\\left(\\strut 1- x(t)\\right)\\) Solving a differential equation is the phrase used for finding such self-consistent functions. This chapter is about techniques for finding solutions. In high-school mathematics, many algebraic problems were of the form, “Solve for \\(x\\).” In such problems, the answer you got was all you were looking for: the complete answer to the problem. Having been exposed to this style in high school, you may have come to think of “finding a solution” as the only task to perform in working on a problem. In working with dynamical systems, “finding a solution” is one of the several tasks, among others, that you might need to perform to serve the purpose of your modeling effort. But not every modeling purpose requires “finding a solution,” that is, finding the function \\(x(t)\\). For instance, the goal of working with a dynamical system is often to sort out other properties of the system, such as the existence, location, and stability of fixed points. (We’ll introduce fixed points in Chapter 49.) Given what you learned in studying Block 3 of this book, you likely will be tempted to approach the task of “finding a solution” by applying symbolic anti-differentiation techniques to the problem. After all, each differential equation in a dynamical system involves a function \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\). To find \\(x(t)\\) from \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) seems like a matter of applying the “fundamental theorem of calculus,” namely \\[\\int \\partial_t x(t) dt = x(t)\\ .\\] Following this logic, we would translate the equation to \\[x(t) = \\int x(t)\\, (1-x(t))dt\\ .\\] But the problems in Block 3 were all of the form \\(\\frac{d\\color{magenta}{x}}{d\\color{blue}{t}} = g(\\color{blue}{t})\\), whereas the problems we work with in this Block are generally of the entirely different form \\(\\frac{d\\color{magenta}{x}}{d\\color{blue}{t}} = g(\\color{magenta}{x})\\). Thus, we will usually need special techniques suited to the format of dynamical systems. Admittedly, in mathematics it is common to refer to integrating a differential equation, but this should be broadly understood as accumulating the increments \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) starting at some initial condition \\(x(t_0)\\), even if that accumulation is not carried out by symbolic anti-differentiation. In this chapter we’ll introduce three different techniques to accumulating a solution to a differential equation or a pair of such equations. First, we’ll look again at the graphical method of “following the flow” in a plot of the flow field. This technique is mainly of use for developing intuition about the dynamics. Second, we’ll develop a simple Euler method for accumulating a solution. Third, we’ll explore how to take a guess about the solution and, when the guess is good enough, refine that into an actual solution. This is called the method of ansätze. Third, and briefly, we’ll look at some of the situations where symbolic anti-differentiation can be used. This includes a very brief introduction to substitution methods. A differential equation like \\[\\partial_t x(t) = x(t)\\,(1-x(t))\\] is very busy typographically. One reason is the repeated \\((t)\\) which play no role other than to state explicitly that \\(x\\) is a function of \\(t\\). A convenient shorthand simply replaces \\(x(t)\\) to make the “is a function of \\(t\\)” implicit. The shorthand form of the equation appears as \\[\\partial_t x = x (1-x)\\ .\\] It’s the reader’s responsibility, knowing that she is working with a differential equation, to remember that \\(x\\) is a function of \\(t\\). In many texts and research papers, differential equations are written using Leibniz’s notation, like this: \\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = x (1-x)\\ .\\] This is exactly equivalent to our notation \\(\\partial_t x\\). An even more concise notation, originated by Isaac Newton, is to replace the \\(\\partial_t\\) with a simple dot over the function being differentiated as in \\(\\Large\\dot{x}\\). With this notation the equation looks like \\[\\dot{x} = x (1-x)\\ ,\\] about as simple as it gets. This dot notation is even more expressive when working with second-order differential equations involving second derivative. In the dot notation, \\(\\partial_{tt} x\\) is written \\(\\ddot{x}\\). Dot notation is also in wide use. Again, it is exactly equivalent to our \\(\\partial_t x\\). 48.1 The flow field With a pair of differential equations, as with the pendulum or the rabbit-fox model, each equation gives one component of the change in state. To draw the flow at single point in state space, evaluate the dynamical functions at that point. Each dynamical function contributes, as its output, one of the components of the state velocity vector. If the parameters in the model have been assigned numerical values, the result of evaluating the right-hand sides will be two numbers. A case in point is the rabbit-fox. The axes in the rabbit-fox state space are denominated in units of rabbit density \\(r\\) and fox density \\(f\\). The differential equations are \\[\\partial_t r = 0.66 r - 1.33 r f\\\\ \\partial_t f = -f + rf\\\\ \\] To to find the state velocity at, say, \\(r=2, f=1/4\\), plug those values into the right-hand side: \\[\\partial_t r = 1.33 - 0.66 = 0.66\\ \\ \\ \\text{rabbit density per month}\\\\ \\partial_t f = -0.25 + 0.5 = 0.25\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{fox density per month}.\\] Once you know the numerical vector value of the state velocity, you need to convert it to a form suitable for plotting in the state space. The conversion is needed because the state space is denominated in rabbit density and fox density, not in rabbit density per month or fox density per month. The conversion is accomplished by multiplying the state velocity vector by a small \\(dt\\), say, 0.1 months. The conversion produces a vector whose components are denominated in the same way as the state space and thus can be plotted meaningfully in the state space. To illustrate, let’s draw a flow vector for the state space coordinate \\((r=2, f = 1/4)\\). Above, we already calculated the components of the state velocity vector;Given the value \\(\\partial_t f = 0.25\\) and \\(\\partial_t f = 0.66\\). For the sake of illustration, we’ll set \\(dt = 0.1\\) month. Consequently, the vector to be plotted will be \\((0.25, 0.66) dt = (0.025, 0.066)\\)$ with units of rabbit density and fox density respectively. the right. This flow arrow is drawn in Figure 48.1. Figure 48.1: The flow arrow for the state value \\((r=2, f=1/4)\\) using \\(dt=0.1\\) month. To draw the entire flow field, repeat this process at many other points in the state space as in Figure 48.2. Figure 48.2: Left: The flow field depicted by drawing the state velocity vector (times \\(dt = 0.1\\)) for many points in the state space. Right: Instead of plotting the state velocity vector, small snippets of trajectories of duration 0.1 are shown. The curvature of the trajectories can help to envision the flow more precisely. Some people prefer a visualization of short segments of actual trajectories, as in the right panel in Figure 48.2, rather than the state velocity vector. This is a matter of personal preference. With the flow field depicted in sufficient detail, you can now trace out trajectory. To trace out a trajectory, select a initial condition for the system. Then follow the flow, taking only a small step in state space. The next step should be in the direction of the flow arrow at the end of the previous step. The trajectory you draw will be only a sketch, but it can be effective for developing intuition. Figure 48.3 shows a semi-automated version of the go-with-the-flow method. The computer has been used to draw the arrows. When you click in the plot, the computer also undertakes calculation of the trajectory. Figure 48.3: The flow field for the rabbit/fox dynamics. Click at an initial state to generate the trajectory from that state. You may need to pinch in or out to see the flow arrows clearly. Regrettably, from such a sketch of the trajectory, you can’t easily construct \\(r(t)\\) and \\(f(t)\\) for time-series plots. Also, you don’t get a sense of how slow or fast the flow is going. Click at different initial conditions in the flow and you will see different trajectories, each of which is a closed loop, the sort of cycles seen in the dice-free Chutes and Ladders game. But the shape of the trajectory doesn’t tell you whether it takes a long time or a short time to complete a loop. The next section will show you how the computer constructed the trajectory and how we can get information on the speed of the flow. 48.2 Euler method Recall from Block 2 the limit definition of the derivative: \\[\\partial_t x(t) = \\lim_{dt \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{x(t + dt) - x(t)}{dt}\\ .\\] We’re going to use this definition to develop a very general way to solve differential equations: the Euler method. The differential equations specify the values of \\(\\partial_t x(t)\\) in terms of the dynamical function. In Block 2, we paid attention to whether the limit actually exists. But here, we know it must because the dynamical functions themselves don’t involve limits. In working with the differential equation it suffices to pick some small, finite \\(dt\\). How small? Pick \\(dt\\) to be small enough that the result wouldn’t change in any substantial way if we used an even smaller time increment, say \\(dt/10\\). Our starting point for solving each differential equation is to re-write it as a finite difference. To illustrate, we’ll solve the equation \\(\\partial_t x = x (1 - x)\\), which is often called the logistic equation. Applying the finite difference definition, we get \\[\\underbrace{\\frac{f(t + dt)- f(t)}{dt}}_{\\text{finite-difference approx.}} = \\underbrace{x (1-x)}_{\\text{dynamical function}}\\ .\\] Multiplying both sides of the above by \\(dt\\) and re-arranging terms produces \\[\\underbrace{f(t + dt)}_{\\text{future state}} = \\underbrace{f(t)}_{\\text{current state}} +\\ \\ \\ \\underbrace{x (1-x) dt}_{\\text{step}}\\] We call this last equation the Euler formula. To use this, we start at the initial condition, say \\(x(t=0) = 0.2\\). This initial condition gives us the first row of a tabular representation of the function \\(x(t)\\): time state 0 0.2 Next, pick a value for \\(dt\\) that we will use for all the following steps, each of which will add a new row to the table. For the example, we’ll set \\(dt = 0.1\\). When we have constructed the whole table we can go back and check whether that was small enough. To fill in the next row, we apply the Euler formula. Sine \\(dt = 0.1\\), the next time step will be \\(0.1\\). Plug in the current state—which is 0.2 right now—to calculate the future state. The step will be \\(0.2 (1-0.2)\\, dt = \\color{brown}{0.016}\\). Add this step to the current state to get the future state. The table now looks like this: time state 0.0 \\(0.2\\) 0.1 \\(0.2 + \\color{brown}{0.016} = \\color{blue}{0.216}\\) The next step will bring us to time \\(0.2\\). Use the Euler formula, pluggin in the value of the present state, \\(\\color{blue}{0.216}\\), to find the step. Here that will be \\(0.216 (1-0.216)\\, dt = \\color{magenta}{0.0169.}\\). Now the table looks like time state 0.0 \\(0.2\\) 0.1 \\(0.2 + \\color{brown}{0.016} = \\color{blue}{0.216}\\) 0.2 \\(\\color{blue}{0.216} + \\color{magenta}{0.0169} = 0.2329\\) Add as many rows to the table as you like; the process will be the same. You will recognize this as an iterative process, as discussed in Chapter 32. Example 48.1 \\(\\ \\) As is so often the case, it’s wise to think about carrying out processes in terms of fundamental tasks accomplished by calculus operations—evaluate, differentiate, anti-differentiate, solve, find argmax, iterate. The obvious choice for integrating differential equations is “anti-differentiate,” but as described previously, the techniques we covered in Block 3 are not sufficient for the task. Instead, we use iteration to solve differential equations. In this example we’re going to use the software you have already seen, Iterate(), to carry out the task. In practice, however, you will use a special form of Iterate() called integrateODE() that makes use of interpolation techniques to give a more precise answer. To implement the iteration to solve \\(\\partial_t x = x (1-x)\\), we need to create a function that takes the current state as input and produces the next state as output. Our one-step function can be this: next_step &lt;- function(t, x, dt=0.1) { t &lt;- t + dt x &lt;- x + x*(1-x)*dt c(t=t, x=x) # return value } Notice that we wrote next_step() with an input slot for \\(dt\\). This will not be part of the state being iterated, just a parameter that allows us easily to explore different values for \\(dt\\). Use Iterate() to carry out the iteration of next_step(). Note that we use the fargs argument to Iterate() to pass our selected value for dt to the function next_step(). We’ll run the iteration for 100 steps. With \\(dt=0.1\\), those 100 steps will 10 units of time. Soln &lt;- Iterate(next_step, x0=c(t=0, x=0.2), n=100, fargs=list(dt=0.1)) n t x 0 0.0 0.2000000 1 0.1 0.2160000 2 0.2 0.2329344 … and so on … 99 9.9 0.9998595 100 10.0 0.9998736 We can now plot the time series \\(x\\) vs \\(t\\): Figure 48.4: The time series by the Euler method with \\(dt=0.01\\). In the previous example using Iterate() to solve a differential equation, the output of the iteration was a data frame containing values for the solution at discrete times: 0, 0.1, 0.2, and so on. A data table is a perfectly good way to represent a function, but it’s handier to have a function in a form that operations like slice_plot() and D() can be applied to. Another way to look at things is that, mathematically, the solution to a differential equation should be a continuous-time function. Fortunately, we have at hand the interpolation techniques covered in Chapter 33 to carry out the construction of a continuous-time function from a tabular representation. The R/mosaic function integrateODE() connects together the iteration and interpolation to provide a solution that is in the form of continuous-time function(s). Use the R/mosaic function integrateODE() to solve differential equations numerically. It is a specialized function that handles sets of first-order differential equations, but any high-order differential equation can be separated into a set of first-order equations. To illustrate, this command will solve the differential equation \\(\\partial_t x = x (1-x)\\) that we took on in the previous example with Iterate(). Soln2 &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x*(1-x), x = 0.2, tdur=list(from=0, to=10, dt=0.01)) The first argument is a tilde expression, but in a form that’s different from from that used in functions such as D() or contour_plot(), etc. To the left of the tilde is a single name composed of the state variable—x here—prefixed by a d. The d is just a reminder that we are describing not x itself, but \\(\\partial_t\\ \\mathtt{x}\\). On the right of the tilde is the function from the differential equation, in this case, \\(x(1-x)\\). The next argument is the initial condition. We’re starting the integration at \\(x=0.2\\). Finally, the argument named tdur= consists of a description of the starting and ending times and the time-step size \\(dt\\). The output of integrateODE() is an R structure of a type called a “list” that is new to us. The list contains the function(s) created by integrateODE() which you refer to by name (x) using a special form of R punctuation $ suited to lists.. In other words, Soln2$x will be a function, which you can plot like any other function, for instance: slice_plot(Soln2$x(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:10)) An important feature of integrateODE() is its ability to handle sets of first-order differential equations. For instance, the rabbit/fox system \\[\\partial_t r = 0.66\\, r - 1.33\\, r f\\\\ \\partial_t f = -f + rf\\] will be integrated by this command: Eco_soln &lt;- integrateODE( dr ~ 0.66*r - 1.33*r*f, df ~ -f + r*f, r = 2, f = 0.5, #initial conditions tdur=list(from=0, to=5, dt=0.1)) You can plot the time series using slice_plot() slice_plot(Eco_soln$r(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:5)) %&gt;% gf_labs(title=&quot;Rabbits&quot;) slice_plot(Eco_soln$f(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:5)) %&gt;% gf_labs(title=&quot;Foxes&quot;) Figure 48.5: Times series of the rabbit and fox densities. To plot the trajectory, use the traj_plot() function. Unlike slice_plot(), which creates a time series plot, traj_plot() shows the trajectory. traj_plot(f(t) ~ r(t), Eco_soln, nt=10) 48.3 Symbolic solutions Occasionally it is possible to integrate a differential equation using symbolic techniques. This is particularly true for differential equations that are linear. The example we will handle here is the first-order linear differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = a\\, x\\ .\\] An advantage of symbolic solutions is that parameters can be handled symbolically. A method we will use repeatedly in this block is called the “method of ansätze.” An ansatz (singular of the German “ansätze”) is, in this context, a guess for the solution. Since differential equations have been a central part of science for more than 200 years, you can imagine that a large library of equations and their solutions has been assembled. For the equations that are most frequently used and that can be solved symbolically, the solutions are already known. Thus, the “guess” for the solution can be a very well informed guess. Let’s see how this works for \\(\\partial_t x = a\\, x\\). From experience, the ansatz will be an exponential function of time, which we can write \\(x(t) \\equiv A e^{\\omega t}\\). We don’t yet know what is the value of \\(\\omega\\) or \\(A\\), so we plug the ansatz into both the left and right sides of the differential equation to work it out. Plugging in the ansatz, translates the differential equation to a new form: \\[\\underbrace{A \\omega e^{\\omega t}}_{\\partial_t x(t)}\\ =\\ \\underbrace{a A e^{\\omega t}}_{a x(t)}\\ .\\] Cancelling out the terms that appear on both sides of the equation gives \\[\\omega = a\\ \\ \\ \\text{which implies}\\ \\ \\ x(t) = A e^{a t}\\ .\\] The ansatz substitution didn’t give any result at all for \\(A\\). That is to say, unlike \\(\\omega\\), the \\(A\\) is not determined by the differential equation itself. This means that \\(A\\) must be related to the initial condition. Setting \\(t=0\\) gives \\(x(0) = A\\), so in this simple differential equation, \\(A\\) is the initial condition. A slightly more complex differential equation is \\[\\partial_t x = a\\, (x - b)\\ .\\] This also has an exponential solution. It’s easiest to see this by defining a new variable \\(y \\equiv x - b\\). By the rules of differentiation, \\(\\partial_t y = \\partial_t x\\), so the differential equation can be re-written in the form \\(\\partial_t y = a y\\). We already know the solution to this is \\(y(t) = y_0 e^{a t}\\). Translating by to \\(x\\) we get \\[x(t) - b = (x_0 -b) e^{at}\\ \\ \\ \\implies x(t) = (x_0 -b)\\,e^{at} + b)\\ .\\] For nonlinear dynamical function, there is no perfectly general way to find symbolic solutions. But for some dynamical functions, it can be done. We’ll demonstrate by integrating \\(\\partial_t x = x (1-x)\\). The method is made more plausible by using the Leibnizian notation for derivatives, with which the differential equation has this form: \\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(1-x)\\ .\\] The Leibnizian notation can be interpreted as the ratio of two differentials: \\(dx\\) and \\(dt\\) in this case. The idea of separating the differential equation is to algebraically move all the \\(x\\) terms to the left side of the equation and all the \\(t\\) terms to the right and then to integrate each side of the equation. \\[dx = x(1-x) dt \\ \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\ \\frac{1}{x(x-1)}dx = dt\\ \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ \\int\\frac{1}{x(x-1)}dx = \\int dt .\\] The integral on the right side, \\(\\int dt\\), should be easily recognizable, giving \\(\\int dt = t + F\\), where \\(F\\) is the “constant of integration.” The integral on the left side may not be as familiar, but the person solving this problem for the second time will remember that \\[\\frac{1}{x(1-x)} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1-x}\\] as you can confirm by putting the right side over a common denominator. Each of \\(1/x\\) and \\(1/(1-x)\\) have integrals that are logs: \\(\\int dx/x = \\ln(x) + D\\) and \\(\\int dx/(1-x) = - \\ln(1-x) + E\\). Putting the equation back together again, produces \\[\\ln(x) + D - \\ln(1-x) + E = t + F\\ .\\] At this point, move all the constants of integration over to the right side and consolate them into a single constant of integration \\(C\\). At the same time, collect together the two logarithmic terms, giving: \\[\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) = t + C\\ .\\] Exponentiate both sides to get: \\[\\frac{x}{1-x} = \\underbrace{e^C}_{A} e^t\\ .\\] Since \\(e^C\\) is just a constant, we’ll write it more simply as \\(A\\). Now we have \\[x = Ae^t - x A e^t \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ x (1 + Ae^t) = Ae^t\\] which gives our solution \\[x = \\frac{Ae^t}{1 + Ae^t}\\ .\\] To find the initial condition symbolically, plug in \\(t=0\\), giving \\(x_0 = A/(1+A)\\) or, equivalently \\(A = x_0/(1-x_0)\\). Our previous examples used \\(x_0 = 0.2\\), for which \\(A = 0.2/0.8 = 0.25\\). Graphing this solution gives us the familiar sigmoid: Symb_soln = makeFun(A*exp(t)/(1 + A*exp(t)) ~ t) slice_plot(Symb_soln(t, A=0.2) ~ t, domain(t=-5:10)) Not all differential equations can be separated in this way, and even for those that can, the integrals may not be tractable. So this route to a solution is not a general-purpose one, unlike the Euler method. Still, the Euler method gives only an approximate solution, so with Euler we need to take care that the approximation is close enough for the purpose at hand. In this case, we have both an Euler solution (with \\(dt=0.1\\)) and a symbolic solution. Figure 48.6 shows the difference between the two solutions, which ideally should be zero. To show more of the time domain of the solution, we’ll reset the initial condition to \\(x_0 = 0.01\\). This corresponds to \\(A = 1/99\\). Figure 48.6: The difference between the Euler and the symbolic solution to \\(\\partial_t x = x (1-x)\\) as a fraction of the symbolic solution. At the worst, the Euler solution is off by 1.5 parts in one-million. 48.4 Exercises O-TEOG4: Recognize a first-order differential equation.

Exercise 47.06: Ku1rfp U-5PMG7 We’re going to explore some common pitfalls for using the integrateODE() and traj_plot() functions. Question A What is the purpose of the integrateODE() function? To translate a dynamical system into a set of numerical solutions, one for each state variable.Correct.  To draw a flow field of the dynamical system.︎✘ To anti-differentiate a differential equation, giving a symbolic solution.︎✘ To plot the trajectory of a dynamical system.︎✘ Question B What is the proper format to use in specifying the dynamical system to integrateODE()? A set of tilde expressions, each one an individual argument.Nice!  A set of named arguments, with the formula on the right-hand side.︎✘ You mean something like dx = x*(1-x)? Close, but not right. Replace the = by ~. A tilde expression is the appropriate form. A set of equations separated by semi-colons.︎✘ In R, arguments are always separated by commas. A set of tilde expressions separated by semi-colons.︎✘ In R, arguments are always separated by commas. Question C What should the left-hand side of the tilde expression look like for a state variable z? dzGood.  z︎✘ zdot︎✘ dt_z︎✘ This makes sense, and mimics the mathematical notation \\(\\partial_t z\\), but the authors of the software decided to use a shorter form. Question D For the dynamical system \\[\\partial_t x = y\\\\\\partial_t y = -x ,\\] what should the integrateODE() command look like? (Note: we’re using ... as a placeholder for other inputs that will be needed by integrateODE().) integrateODE(dx ~ y, dy ~ -x, ...)Nice!  integrateODE(dx = y, dy = -x, ...)︎✘ That’s using named arguments, not the tilde expression form. integrateODE(dx ~ y, dy = -x, ...)︎✘ You’ve got a tilde expression (correctly) for the first argument, but the second is a named argument rather than a tilde expression. It’s easy to make such a mistake. Question E Aside from the tilde-expressions encoding the dynamical system, what other information is absolutely essential to specify when constructing a numerical solution? The initial condition for each and every state variable.Excellent! There needs to be a starting point for the trajectory. That choice is up to you.+ The trajectory.︎✘ This is what integrateODE() will calculate so long as you use it properly. The time series.︎✘ This is what integrateODE() will calculate so long as you use it properly. The initial condition for at least one of the state variables.︎✘ You need to give an initial condition for each and every state variable. Question F How should you specify how long you want integrateODE() to carry forward the solution in time, say for 10 time units?     tdur=10\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       duration=10︎✘        t=10︎✘        for=10︎✘ Exercise 47.07: tNLucT U-5PMG7 V-4KF8Q K-LH9CX N-9IU5J This system of differential equations, called the Lorenz equations is famous as the first widely recognized example of a type of motion called chaos. What are the state variables and what are the parameters? What is the dimension of the state space? For initial conditions \\(x_0 = -5.276, y_0 = -7.152, z_0=19.452\\) and \\(\\rho=28\\), \\(\\sigma=10\\), and \\(\\beta=8/3\\), use integrateODE() to integrate the equations over \\(tdur=100\\) time units with a stepsize of \\(dt=0.01\\). (This means you should set the tdur= argument to tdur=list(from=0, to=50, dt=0.01)) Call your trajectory T1. Based on your results in (3), what are the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) at time \\(t=50\\). Make a time series plot of \\(x(t)\\). Note that \\(x(t)\\) jumps between a oscillation with negative \\(x\\) and the same kind of oscillation with positive \\(x\\). Plot out the \\(y\\) component of the trajectory versus the \\(x\\) component of the trajectory. To get a smooth plot, you will have to use the npts=10000 argument to traj_plot(). The trajectory will appear to cross itself, but this is because you are only plotting two of the state variables. Create another trajectory T2 in the same way you made T1. But change each of the initial conditions in the third decimal point. Then plot out the \\(x(t)\\) time series for T1 (with color=\"blue\") and the \\(x(t)\\) time series for T2 (with color=“red”`) on the same axes. The two time series will track one another very closely, but then come out of sync with one another. The characteristic feature of chaos is that a small change in initial conditions can lead to a very large change in the time series. How long does it take for the two time series in (7) to become utterly out of sync with one another? The function traj_plot_3D() provides a simple way to look at the trajectory in 3 dimensions. Such a plot shows that the trajectory does not in fact cross itself. Use this command: traj_plot_3D(x, y, z, T1, npts=5000) Exercise 47.09: jd6HE8 The differential equation \\(\\partial_t x = a x\\) is so commonly encountered that you should simply memorize the solution: \\[x(t) = A e^{a t}\\] which you can recognize as exponential growth (or decay, if \\(a &lt; 0\\)) from an initial condition \\(x_0 = A\\). Exponential growth is considered fast, but there are far faster forms of growth. To illustrate, consider the differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = a x^2\\ .\\] This can be interpreted in terms of a model of the size of the flame as one lights a match. Think of the flame as a ball of hot gas of radius \\(x\\); the gas include oxygen (O_2_), nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, as well as a vapor of the combustible material such as the potassium chlorate of the match head. Within the ball of flame, O_2_ reacts with the cumbustible material to produce the products of combustion and heat. Needless to say, this reaction eliminates the O_2_ in the ball. But O_2_ can diffuse into the ball from outside. The O_2_ infusion rate available in this way is proportional to the surface area of the ball, that is, \\(a x^2\\). Thus the differential equation models the growth of the flame ball. The match-flame equation is one that can be separated into parts: all the \\(x\\) components on one side, the \\(t\\) on the other. That is: \\[\\underbrace{\\frac{dx}{dt} = a x^2}_{\\text{original DE}}\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\underbrace{\\frac{dx}{x^2} = a dt}_{\\text{separated DE}}\\] Integrating both sides of the separated equation will produce \\(a t + C\\) on the right side. A. Integrate the left side of the separated equation and use that to find a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(a t + C\\). B. The constant of integration, \\(C\\), will reflect the initial condition. Plug in \\(t=0\\) and calculate from the relationship in (A) what is \\(C\\) in terms of \\(x_0\\). C. Replace \\(C\\) in your relationship with the expression in terms of \\(x_0\\) you found in (B). Confirm that this is \\[x(t) = \\frac{1}{a t - 1/x_0}\\ .\\] D. \\(x(t)\\) has a vertical asymptote. Find it. E. Use integrateODE() to integrate the original differential equation. You will have to pick some numerical value for \\(a\\) and \\(x_0\\). Take care to make \\(dt\\) small enough. You’ll know that \\(dt\\) is small enough when you get the approximately same solution using \\(dt/10\\). F. Describe in everyday words what the solution says and how big the ball of flame becomes. The model \\(\\partial_t x = a x^2\\), like all models, includes some features of the real-world system and excludes others. In this case, once the ball reaches a critical diameter, there is no longer enough combustion product to continue the reaction at the rate depicted in the model. If you watch a match being lit, you will see both the explosion and the eventual exhaustion of the combustion material. Exercise 47.11: 5DVPWG This activity makes use of the following app: Click on the picture of the app and it will open in a new browser tab. Arrange that new tab side-by-side with the one where you are reading this. To solve a differential equation with the Euler method, you need two things: The differential equation itself. Several choices are available in the selector on the left side of the app. On the right side of the equation is the dynamics(x) function. An initial condition \\(x(0)\\). You can select this with the slider. You will also need A stepsize \\(h\\). So long as this is “small enough,” the specifics don’t really matter. How Euler works The first row of the table shows the situation at \\(t=0\\). At that time, the value of \\(x\\), that is \\(x(t=0)\\) is the initial condition that you set with the slider. In the following, whenever we write \\(x(t)\\) we mean \\(x\\) at the time in the last row of the table. Knowing the value of \\(x(t)\\) the instantaneous value of \\(\\partial_t x\\) can be found by plugging \\(x(t)\\) into the dynamics() function. Now that we know \\(\\partial_t x\\), we know how fast \\(x\\) is changing. Multiply this rate of change by \\(h\\) to get the total change of \\(x\\) for the next step. Add a new row to the table at \\(t+h\\) with the \\(x\\)-value from the previous row added to the total change of \\(x\\) from that previous row. Loop back to (a) each time the “step” button is pressed. Select \\(\\partial_t x = -0.5 x\\) as the differential equation to solve. Press “step” several times. After each step, try to understand from the table and graphs why the new row added to the table is what it is.

The figure shows that the Euler solution (with \\(dt=0.1\\)) has an approximation error that’s small. The worst case is when \\(t \\approx 3\\) at which point it is less than 1.5 parts per million. Another good way to quantify this is the decimal place at which the calculated solutions differ.

"],["flow-on-line.html", "Chapter 49 Flows on the line 49.1 Dynamical function and flow 49.2 Generic behavior 49.3 Linearization 49.4 Bifurcation 49.5 Exercises", " Chapter 49 Flows on the line The previous two chapters presented ideas relating to dynamical systems: state, state-space, dynamical function, flow, trajectory, “solution.” Now we turn to the some of the phenomena seen in dynamical systems, starting in the simplest way possible: dynamical systems with a single state variable. We’ll focus on fixed points and their stability, which can be understood qualitatively (although you need to distinguish between a positive and a negative slope). Then we’ll look at a technique we have encountered since Block 2: approximation of a function by a straight-line function. Such linear dynamics have a straightforward exponential “solution.” Finally, we’ll look at an important example of how careful observation of fixed points and the way dynamics change when we modify a parameter in the dynamical functions provides an understanding of a ecological stability and instability and the consequences that result. 49.1 Dynamical function and flow In the previous chapter, we saw how to draw a flow field in a two-dimensional state space, evaluating the dynamical functions and using the results to construct a vector. We can’t practically visualize both the flow and the shapes of the two dynamical functions in a single plot, which makes it harder to understand structures such as fixed points. Happily, with a one-dimensional state space, we can easily show both the flow vectors and the single dynamical function at once. For ease of reference, we’ll name the dynamical function for the rest of this section \\(f(x)\\), so that the differential equation is \\[\\partial_t x = f(x)\\ .\\] The flow itself appears as the example in Figure 49.1. The state space is the number line and the flow vectors are, as usual arrows that point from place to place in the state space. Figure 49.1: A one-dimensional state space shown with its flow vectors. Because the state space can be drawn without using the vertical coordinate of the page, we can use that vertical coordinate to show something else: the dynamical function, as in Figure 49.2. Figure 49.2: A one-dimensional state space shown with its flow vectors. The correspondence between the dynamical function and the flow field is easy to see in such a presentation. Where the output of the dynamical is large and positive (say, near \\(x=0\\)), the flow is in the positive direction and relatively fast, as shown by a long, right-pointing flow vector. When the output of the dynamical function is negative (around \\(x=3\\), for instance) the flow is in the negative direction: a left pointing arrow. Near a zero crossing of the dynamical function, the flow arrows are negligibly short: the state velocity is very slow. Indeed, at the zero crossings, the state velocity is exactly zero. Such zero crossings are called fixed points: since the state velocity is zero, the state never moves! We can see the dynamics near fixed points more closely by zooming in, as in Figure 49.3 which shows two of the system’s fixed points. Figure 49.3: Zooming in on the flow for the system shown in Figure 49.2. Notice in Figure 49.3 that the flow is slower the nearer the state is to the fixed point, but it is only exactly zero at the fixed point. A calculus technique you will be familiar with from previous Blocks is zooming in a region that we want to examine in detail. Figure 49.4: Zooming in closely on each of the fixed points seen in Figure 49.3. The short pieces of the dynamical function shown in Figure 49.4, are, like short pieces of any continuous function: almost exactly straight lines. For the left fixed point, the dynamical function is \\(f(x) \\approx -2.804 (x + 3.055)\\) while for the right it is \\(f(x) \\approx 5.065 (x + 1.586)\\). In Section 48.3 we found symbolically the solutions for dynamical functions in this form. For \\(x_0\\approx-3.055\\) the solution is \\[x(t) \\approx (x_0 + 3.055)e^{-2.804 t} - 3.055\\ ,\\] while for \\(x_0\\approx -1.586\\) the solution is \\[x(t) \\approx (x_0 +1.586)\\, e^{5.065 t} - 1.586\\ .\\] There is something fundamentally different about these two solutions. One of them is exponential decay toward the fixed point, while the other grows exponentially away from the fixed point. We call the dynamics near the fixed-point with exponential decay stable and the dynamics near fixed-point with exponential growth unstable. ::: {.takenote data-latex=\"\"} Graphics such as Figure 49.2 let you see both the flow and the dynamical functions together in one place. How about also showing trajectories? Unfortunately, the two-dimensional extent of a computer screen or a piece of paper make it hard to include still more information in an intelligible way. It would be nice to have a third dimension for the display. Major Austin Davis developed such a display, using time as the third dimension. In the movie below, the state space is shown as a horizontal line, as before. The vertical axis shows the dynamical function as in Figure 49.2. The dynamical function is shown in another way: as the hue and intensity of color, which lets you focus on the activity in the state space. This activity is shown by the moving gray triangles. Each triangle is placed on the phase line to mark an initial condition, then moves right or left according to the dynamics. Sorry, your browser doesn&#39;t support mp4 videos. ::: 49.2 Generic behavior So long as two dynamical systems have similar fixed points with the same stability, their trajectories will be much the same. For example, our model dynamical function might be different in detail, as in Figure 49.5, and still produce the same behavior. ## Warning: Removed 32 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). Figure 49.5: The dynamical function shown in black is a distortion of \\(f(x)\\) from the previous plots. Yet the flow field is practically identical and leads to the same outcomes as \\(f(x)\\) for any initial condition. So long as two flows have similar fixed points with the same stability, their trajectories will be much the same. Consequently, studying the fixed points without worrying about the details of the dynamics gives a huge amount of information about the system. For example, Figure 49.6 shows a score of different time series following the solutions from a score of initial conditions. The long-term behaviors for all the time series is similar: they converge to one or another of the stable fixed points. Figure 49.6: Time series from the differential equation \\(\\partial_t x = f(x)\\) starting at many initial conditions. The locations of the three fixed points are marked with horizontal lines. All the solutions convert to one or the other of the two stable fixed points in the system, and depart from the unstable fixed point. It’s worth pointing out a consequence of the mathematics of continuous functions: if a system with a continuous dynamical function has a region of state space with two different fixed points, there must be an unstable fixed point in between them. 49.3 Linearization You can see in Figure 49.6 that many of the solutions approach their final, equilibrium value in an exponential manner. This is particularly true for the solutions with initial conditions very near the stable fixed points. All these solutions are characterized quantitatively by the parameter \\(a\\) in the exponential solution \\(A e^{a t}\\). (Remember, \\(a &lt; 0\\) when there is exponential decay.) Quantitative knowledge of \\(a\\) is helpful to understand the time scale of the exponential approach to stable fixed points. We can find a numerical value for \\(a\\) for each fixed point by constructing a linear approximation to the dynamical function near each of the fixed points. The procedure involves the same principles as introduced in Block 2 for constructing low-order polynomial approximations to functions, but here “low-order” means “first order.” The analysis is done separately for each of the fixed points, so the first step is to find the fixed points, the values \\(x^\\star\\) such that \\(f(x^\\star) = 0\\). Recall from Block 2 the Taylor polynomial approximation to a function \\(f(x)\\) centered on a point \\(x^\\star\\): \\[f(x) \\approx f(x^\\star) + \\partial_x f(x^\\star) \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\] When \\(x^\\star\\) is a fixed point, \\(f(x^\\star) = 0\\) so the approximation is simply \\(f(x) \\approx \\partial_x f(x^\\star) \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\). Keep in mind that \\(\\partial_x f(x^\\star)\\) is the derivative function \\(\\partial_x f\\) evaluated at the input \\(x^\\star\\), so \\(\\partial_x f(x^star)\\) is simply a quantity, not a function. Indeed, \\(\\partial_x f(x^star)\\) is exactly the quantity \\(a\\) in the exponential solution \\(e^{a t}\\). This process of constructing the linear approximation \\(f(x) \\approx a \\left[x - x^\\star\\right]\\) is called linearization. Example 49.1 Consider the first-order differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = f(x) \\equiv r x (x - x/K)\\] where \\(r\\) and \\(K\\) are parameters that are greater than zero. Linearizing the nonlinear function \\(f(x)\\) lets us figure out how fast or slow is the exponential growth or decay of the solutions for initial conditions near the fixed points. There are two fixed points, one at \\(x_1^\\star = 0\\) and the other at \\(x_2^\\star = K\\). What is the exponential parameter \\(a\\) for each of the fixed points. The derivative (with respect to \\(x\\)) \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) can be found with the product rule from Block 2. It is \\[\\partial_x f(x) = r\\, (1 - x/K) - r\\, x\\, (1/K)\\] Evaluating \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) at the two fixed points \\(x_1^\\star = 0\\) and \\(x_2^\\star = K\\) gives \\[\\partial_x f(x_1^\\star) = r\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\partial_x f(x_2^\\star) = -r\\] Solutions near \\(x_1^\\star\\) will grow exponentially as \\(e^{r t}\\), unstable since \\(0 &lt; r\\). Solutions near \\(x_2^\\star\\) will decay toward \\(x_2^\\star\\) in an exponential manner as \\(e^{-r t}\\). It’s critical to distinguish carefully between \\(x^\\star\\), which is the location of the fixed point being examined, and \\(x_0\\), which is the initial condition of the state, that is, \\(x(t=0)\\). Example 49.2 \\(\\ \\) Let’s return to the model of saving for retirement in Chapter 47: \\[\\partial_t V = r\\, V + M\\ .\\] The state variable here is named \\(V\\). The dynamical function is \\[g(V) = r\\, V + M\\] where \\(r\\) is the interest rate (say, 3% per year which is \\(r=0.03\\) per year) and \\(M\\) is the monthly contribution. To keep the units consistent, we set the units of \\(t\\) to be years, of \\(r\\) to be 1/years, of \\(V\\) to be dollars and of \\(M\\) to be dollars-per-year. So a monthly contribution of $1000 would come to \\(M=12000\\) dollars-per-year. Find the amount \\(V\\) that will result from 30 years of savings with an initial condition \\(V_0 = 0\\). Step i) Find the fixed point. This is a value \\(V^\\star\\) such that \\[r\\, V^\\star + M = 0\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\ V^\\star = -M/r\\ .\\] Step ii) Find the derivative of the dynamical function evaluated at the fixed point: Since \\(g(V)\\) happens to be a straight-line function, we know the derivative is a constant. So \\(b = \\partial_x g(V^\\star) = r\\). Step iii) Translate the state variable into \\(y = V - V^\\star\\). The dynamics in terms of \\(y\\) are \\(\\partial_t y = b y\\), which has an exponential solution \\(y = A e^{bt}\\). Step iv) \\(A\\) is the initial condition in terms of \\(y\\). This will be \\(y_0 = V_0 - V^\\star\\). Since we stated that \\(V_0 = 0\\) (no savings at the start), \\(y_0 = -V^\\star\\) and the solution is \\[y(t) = -V^\\star e^{bt} = \\frac{M}{r} e^{rt}\\ .\\] Step v) Translate the solution in step (iv) back into terms of \\(V(t)\\). Since \\(y(t) = V(t) - V^\\star\\), this will be \\(V(t) = y(t) + V^\\star\\) or, \\[V(t) = \\frac{M}{r} e^{r t} + V^\\star = \\frac{M}{r} \\left[ e^{r t} - 1\\right]\\ .\\] To get an idea of this retirement plan, that is, \\(r=3\\%\\) and \\(M=12000\\) dollars-per-year, let’s see how much you’ll have after 30 years and 40 years.

Is it sustainable to burn fossil fuels at steady historical levels, let alone at the increasing rate seen since over the last century? Climate scientists answer resoundingly with a no. Is it sustainable to increase food production to the levels needed for developing economies to approach the sort of consumption seen in rich economies? Dynamical systems are highly relevant to the questions surrounding sustainability. If the economy is near a stable fixed point, then it is sustainable; the trajectory will bring the state of the economy toward the fixed point. On the other hand, if the economy is near an unstable fixed point, we can expect exponential change. If such exponential changes are not seen, does that mean we’re not near an unstable fixed point? One of the terms used to mark the possibility that a stable system can quickly turn unstable is tipping point, defined as The point at which a series of small changes or incidents becomes significant enough to cause a larger, more important change. Source: New Oxford American Dictionary The mathematics of tipping points is not at all the same as exponential growth. Certainly, in exponential growth one sees a relatively slow rate of change increase to a large rate of change, a situation described by journalists as “sky-rocketing” or “explosive” or, literally, “exponential.” As you’ve seen, exponential growth is a phenomenon seen in linear dynamical systems; there is no special point at which the dynamics changes. There is actually an area of mathematical theory called catastrophe theory. We’ll use a famous example to show how catastrophes or tipping points are modeled mathematically. The example comes from a 1977 article in Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals. The article, by Robert May, is entitled “Thresholds and breakpoints in ecosystems with a multiplicity of stable states.” The words “thresholds” and “breakpoints” have not been encountered yet in this book, but “multiplicity of stable states” should bring to mind the sort of dynamics seen in Figure 49.2. The setting for the catastrophe is an otherwise bucolic scene, livestock grazing on a pasture. A pasture is a kind of factory for producing vegetable biomass; the grazing is the consumption of the biomass produced. As a model for the production of biomass, denoted \\(v\\) for “vegetation,” we’ll use \\[\\partial_t v = r v \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{K}\\right)\\] which, as we’ve seen, has an unstable fixed point at \\(v_1^\\star=0\\) and a stable fixed point at \\(v_2^\\star=K\\). Physically, the fixed point \\(v_1^\\star\\) corresponds to a bare field, without any vegetation. It’s unstable because any small disturbance in the form of a stray seed landing in the dirt can lead to germination and the rapid growth of vegetation as seeds from the germinated plant spread across the field. Once the field is covered in vegetation, the growth can be exponentially rapid at first but then runs into limited resources: there is only so much sunlight that falls on the field, and the growing vegetation will eventually consume the soil nutrients and water. This biomass production model corresponds to a sustainable system. Once the biomass level is at \\(v_2^\\star\\) it will stay there. But biomass production is not the only thing going on in the pasture. The grazing animals—let’s imagine they are cows—are consuming the grass. To start very simply, suppose that each cow consumes amount \\(C\\) of biomass each day. If there are \\(H\\) cows, the total consumption is \\(H C\\) per day. This modifies the dynamics to a slightly new form \\[\\partial_t v = r \\,v(1-\\frac{v}{K}) - HC\\]. The original, ungrazed dynamics are compared with the grazed dynamics in Figure 49.7. Figure 49.7: Comparing the pasture dynamics for different herd sizes. With grazing, the net growth of biomass is reduced due to the removal of the consumed biomass by the cows’ consumption. For a moderate herd size, there is still a stable fixed point, but it is at a lower level of biomass than would be seen in the ungrazed field. But if the herd size is too large, the ecosystem completely collapses. This is an example of a tipping point or catastrophe. For moderate herd sizes, there remains a stable fixed point. A farmer might be tempted to add another cow to the pasture, and that’s sustainable: there is still a stable fixed point. Indeed, the movement of the stable fixed point might not even be noticed. But add even one cow too many and the fixed point entirely disappears. Still, herd management can fix the problem; take away the cow that tipped the pasture and the fixed point will return. We’ve often referred to the modeling cycle, using the results of a model to suggest possible improvements in the model. Missing from the pasture model is a simple idea of how cows eat. If there is very little biomass, the cows can’t continue to eat their fill. Will the reduction in consumption per cow preserve the stable fixed point? In his Nature article, May modeled the consumption rate by a single cow with the functional form \\[C(v) \\equiv \\frac{\\beta v^2}{v_0 - v^2}\\] which is graphed for \\(\\beta=0.1\\) and \\(v_0 = 3\\) in Figure 49.8 consumption &lt;- makeFun((beta*v^2/(v0^2 + v^2))~ v, beta=0.1, v0=1) slice_plot(consumption(v) ~ v, domain(v=c(0,10))) %&gt;% gf_labs(y=&quot;Consumption (tons/day)&quot;, x=&quot;v: available biomass (tons)&quot;) Figure 49.8: Consumption of vegetation by a single cow as a function of the amount available in the pasture. You can recognize this as a form of sigmoid. When the amount of vegetation is very large, a cow will eat her fill. That’s the saturation of the sigmoid. For small \\(v\\), the cow needs to hunt around for vegetation tall enough to eat, reducing the consumption steeply. Figure 49.9 modifies the pasture dynamics to incorporate this sigmoidal model of consumption. Figure 49.9: Pasture dynamics for a sigmoidal consumption function. We can start the story with 3 cows in the pasture. Vegetation growth is more than sufficient to provide for these cows. You can see this from the stable fixed point at about 9 tons of biomass, which is more than enough to reach saturation of the sigmoidal consumption function. The farmer decides to increase the herd to 5 cows. Nothing much happens. The stable fixed point is at about 8 tons of biomass, entirely adequate to keep the cows well fed in a sustainable manner. Can the pasture be sustainable with 7 cows? The stable fixed point remains, now at about 6.5 tons at biomass. The cows are still sustainably well fed. You can see in the 7-cow dynamics a hint of what of what might go wrong. There is a new, unstable fixed point at about 3 tons of biomass. If the pasture ever happened transiently to fall below 3 tons—say due to a summer frost followed by a return to normal weather—the vegetation biomass will head toward the new stable fixed point at 0.5 tons of biomass. At this level, the cows are eating only about one-quarter their normal amount and we can fairly say that the ecosystem has collapsed. But until such a disaster happens, the farmer will see only a sustainable level of biomass with cows well fed. It is only we, who have a mathematical model of the situation, who can anticipate the potential problems. Since things are fine with 7 cows in the field, the farmer lets an eighth cow join the herd. That’s the tipping point. The happy herd fixed point at 6.5 tons of biomass has disappeared, and the ecosystem collapses, even without a weather disaster. Removing the eighth cow from the pasture will not fix the situation. With seven or even six cows in the pasture, the system won’t be able to grow out of the stable fixed point with 0.5 tons of biomass. Reducing the herd size to five will remove that 0.5 ton fixed point, but the grass will grow back very slowly; the dynamics give positive growth, but very close to zero. Avoiding such catastrophes is a major motivation for mathematical modeling. 49.5 Exercises V-YGS71: Find the location of fixed points in a one-state-variable system by finding zeros of the dynamical function: graphically or computationally when all parameters are known analytically in simple cases (e.g. quadratic polynomial) J-YOLEG: Deduce the stability of a fixed point by: examination of the slope of the dynamical function in a first-order system F-QSK86: Identify the long-term behavior of trajectories starting near an unstable fixed point.

Exercise 49.21: cAKQiT L-ZPDIJ In the cows eating grass model, we proposed the model \\[ \\partial_t v = \\frac{v}{3} \\left(1-\\frac{v}{25}\\right)\\] for the growth of grass in the field, where \\(v\\) is in tons of biomass and \\(t\\) A. According to the model, what is the carrying capacity of the field? B. The field is most productive when the grass is growing at the highest rate possible. At what level of vegetation biomass is the biomass increasing the most rapidly? C. At that most productive level of biomass, what is the rate of growth of the vegetation? (Make sure to give units.) Exercise 49.23: L6hTUu V-YGS71 Consider a hay field that has just been harvested in the middle of summer. The grass has been cut short and the weather is still conducive to growth. What’s going to happen? The grass will grow back, a very simple model of which will be \\(\\partial_t G(t) \\equiv C\\). This rate, \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\), corresponds to the grass growing back at a constant rate. Imagine we measure this rate as tons of biomass per day, and measure time \\(t\\) in days. Question A To model the everyday real world of growing grass, should \\(C\\) be positive or negative? positiveNice!  negative︎✘ The amount of grass would be decreasing. This is not what we ordinarily think of as “growing” zero︎✘ \\(\\partial_t G(t) = 0\\) implies no change at all. Question B What units does the output \\(G(t)\\) have? tons per day︎✘ These are the units of \\(C\\) and therefore, because of the equality, of \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\). We’re asking about the units of \\(G(t)\\), not \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\). tonsExcellent!  days︎✘ This is the unit of the input \\(t\\), not the output \\(G(t)\\). tons/day^2︎✘ Question C Which of these equations best describes the trajectory of the growing grass under the \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\) dynamics?     \\(G(t) = G(0) + C\\)︎✘        \\(G(t) = G(0) + C t\\)\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       \\(G(t) = G(0)\\sin(t/C)\\)︎✘        \\(G(t) = G(0) t + C\\)︎✘ Question D According to the dynamics \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\), what will \\(G(t)\\) look like (without future harvesting)? Growth until the field is choked up with grass.︎✘ Growth without limit.Nice!  Oscillating growth and decline as the seasons pass.︎✘ This might be the case in the real world, but the simple model does not incorporate seasonality. There are two obvious shortcomings of the model \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\). First, when the amount of grass is very small (think little spouts spread widely apart) growth should much smaller than when the grass is plentiful. Second, at some point the grass is so dense that further growth is impossible, so \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\) falls to zero (or even negative). The maximum amount of biomass that can be sustained by the field is called the grass’s carrying capacity. The standard simple model for a system with growth to a carrying capacity is \\[\\partial_t G(t) = r G(t)(K-G(t))\\] This model is famous and has a name: logistic growth. Question E The logistic growth model has two fixed points. What are they? \\(G=0\\) and \\(G=K\\)Right!  \\(G=0\\) and \\(G=1/K\\)︎✘ Plug \\(1/K\\) into the dynamics in place of \\(G\\). Do you get \\(\\partial_t G = 0\\)? \\(G = \\pm K\\)︎✘ Plug \\(-K\\) into the dynamics in place of \\(G\\). Do you get \\(\\partial_t G=0\\)? \\(G=0\\) and \\(G=-K\\)︎✘ Plug \\(-K\\) into the dynamics in place of \\(G\\). Do you get \\(\\partial_t G=0\\)? Question F Which of these stories best describes the trajectory of the logistics growth version of \\(G(t)\\) starting with \\(G(0)\\) very small but positive? The grass grows slowly at first, then gradually growth speeds up and stays high.︎✘ The grass grows rapidly at first then declines gradually to no growth.︎✘ The grass grows slowly, then grows faster until it reaches a biomass where the growth rate declines steadily to zero.Excellent!  Here are three graphs. Question G Which of the graphs represents a possible trajectory \\(G(t)\\)? A︎✘ BRight!  C︎✘ This is a graph of dynamics, not the trajectory. Look at the x-axis label. none of them︎✘ Exercise 49.25: 61zaad J-YOLEG V-YGS71 Consider the differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = \\sin(x)^2 + x + 1\\ .\\] Where is the fixed point? Is the fixed point stable? Exercise 49.27: qd50WJ J-YOLEG V-YGS71 The interactive app displayed below implements a version of the pasture-cow dynamics with different parameters than the one in the main body of the text. The app draws the various functions involved: The intrinsic logistic model growth dynamics with no cows. The total consumption by the herd of cows. The net growth, which is the difference between (1) and (2). And, you can play the role of farmer by changing the herd size. Using the app, answer these two questions: How many cows can you put in the pasture before the addition of even a single additional cow will cause collapse of the ecosystem? Once a collapse has occurred, how many cows will you need to remove in order for the pasture to show growth toward a healthy equilibrium? Exercise 49.29: 9qOKUM Figure 49.8 shows a model of a cow’s consumption of vegetation as a sigmoidal function of the amount of vegetation. In addition to the mathematics of the function, it’s helpful to be able to translate the shape of the function into terms that make sense in the context of the model. Question A At what level of available biomass is the cow most hungry at the end of the day? (Hint: Think about how you would measure how hungry a cow is at the end of the day.) 2 tonsCorrect. The consumption function is steepest here, meaning that if more grass were available the cow would eat the biggest proportion of it. 5 tons︎✘ The level of hunger can be measured by the slope of the consumption curve. If a cow would eat a lot more if the biomass were available, she must be hungry. 10 tons︎✘ The level of hunger can be measured by the slope of the consumption curve. If a cow would eat a lot more if the biomass were available, she must be hungry. 15 tons︎✘ Even if more grass were available, the cow wouldn’t each much of it. So, the cow is not very hungry. Exercise 49.31: FUIt1Q A debit card is a way to make withdrawals from a bank account. Funds in the account earn interest. In the economic environment of 2021, the interest rate is practically zero. But to make it possible to see the growth on a graph, we will stipulate it to be 4% per year. But if the account is in debt, then the debt grows at a much faster rate, perhaps 15% per year. Suppose the amount in the bank account is \\(m\\) (in dollars) and time is \\(t\\) (in years). If \\(m\\) is positive, you are earning interest. If negative, you are in debt and the debt will grow.

"],["flow-on-plane.html", "Chapter 50 Flows on the plane 50.1 Generic behaviors 50.2 Linearization 50.3 Exercises", " Chapter 50 Flows on the plane Let’s return the rabbit/fox system as an example of flow. Since there are two state quantities, \\(r\\) and \\(f\\), the state space \\((r, f)\\) is a plane. At each point in the state space, the flow vector gives the direction and speed of motion. Like all vectors, a flow vector has only two properties: the direction and length. The speed of motion is the length of the flow vector. The flow itself is a vector field. This is an assignment of a vector to each point of the state space. Graphically, we depict a flow field by selecting a grid of points in the state space, finding the flow vector for each grid point, and drawing those vectors positioned at their respective grid points. Figure 50.1: The flow field has a vector at each point in state space but we can draw only a few if the plot is to be legible. Zooming in on a region produces more detail. Recall from Block 5 that it’s conventional to specify a vector by giving a coordinate pair for the tip of the vector with the understanding that the tail is at the origin. For the rabbit/fox system, the tip’s coordinate is \\(\\left({\\Large\\strut} g_r(r, f),\\ g_f(r, f)\\right)\\). This notation is potentially confusing, because the letters \\(r\\) and \\(f\\) appear in so many places. Each each vector in Figure ?? is drawn at a particular point, say \\((r=0.96, f=0.48)\\). At that point, evaluate the dynamical functions: \\(g_r(r=0.96, f=0.48) = 0.0207\\) and \\(g_r(r=0.96, f=0.48)= 0.941\\). A fixed point of the dynamics is a point in the state space where the dynamical functions both evaluate to zero. It’s convenient to mark fixed points as the intersection of zero contours of the dynamical functions. Figure 50.2 shows these zero contours (red for rabbits, blue for foxes) laid on top of the flow field. Such zero contours of dynamical functions are called nullclines. (The word means “zero slope”. “Null” corresponds to zero and “cline” is the root of words like “incline” or “decline.”) Figure 50.2: Flow field and nullclines for the rabbit/fox dynamics. Due to the nature of fixed points, if the initial condition is at the intersection of the nullclines the state will not change. But is the fixed point stable or unstable. As you will see, in two and higher dimensional dynamical systems, there is more than one kind of stability and more than one kind of instability. These different kinds of stability and instability have a direct correspondence to different kinds of behavior in real-world systems. Very near the fixed point, dynamics are approximately linear. We’ll return to a quantitative analysis of this in Chapter 52. Our objective here is to show that there are several generic types of behavior and that the stability of dynamics near the fixed point has to be one of a handful of different types. 50.1 Generic behaviors On a nullcline of a dynamical variable \\(x\\), the \\(x\\)-component of the flow must be zero. The flow will point to positive \\(x\\) on one side of the nullcline and negative \\(x\\) on the other. This is really nothing more than saying that on one side of a zero contour the function value is positive and on the other side negative. We’ll indicate this on the following diagrams by shading the positive side of the nullcline with the same color as the nullcline itself. Figure 50.3 shows the nullclines of a linear system on separate plots. Notice that flow in the shaded side of the \\(x\\) (red) nullcline the flow always has a positive component to the right. Similarly, in the shaded side of the \\(y\\) (blue) nullcline, the flow always has a positive component to the right. Figure 50.3: The nullclines of a linear dynamical system near the fixed point. \\(x\\) nullcline is red, \\(y\\) nullcline is blue Placing both nullclines on the same plot divides the region near the fixed point into four parts. This is generic behavior. Unless the two nullclines are exactly the same as each other, the two nullclines split the region into four quadrants. Figure 50.4: Four quadrants of linear dynamics near the fixed point. We can identify the quadrants by their color—white, red, blue, purple. In each quadrant, the “compass direction” of all flow vectors point to one quadrant of the compass: white to the south-west, red to the south-east, blue to the north-west, and purple to the north-east. This particular linear flow is unstable. Notice that any initial condition in the purple quadrant will lead to a NE trajectory, away from the fixed point. Similarly, any initial condition in the white quadrant leads to a SW trajectory, again away from the fixed point. For an initial condition in the red or blue quadrants, the flow will take the trajectory into either the white or purple quandrants. The initial part of the trajectory may be towards the fixed point, but as soon as the trajectory crosses into white or purple territory, the trajectory leads away from the fixed point. So, the overall flow is unstable. This particular type of instability, where the initial path might be toward the fixed point but eventually leads away from it, is called a saddle. The flow is analogous to the movement of a marble placed on a horse saddle; it might start to roll toward the center of the saddle, but eventually it will roll off to the side. All linear flows will lead to this quadrant structure. Another feature of the structure is that the white quadrant must always be opposite to the purple, and the red opposite to the blue. This allows us to enumerate the different possible types of stability. A very compact summary of the dynamics shows just the four compass directions and the relative positions of the quadrants. For instance, \\[\\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{red}{\\searrow} &amp; \\color{purple}{\\nearrow}\\\\\\hline \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} &amp; \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} \\end{array}\\ ,\\] corresponds to the saddle flow seen in the previous flow field. There are, altogether, eight possible configurations: $$ \\[\\begin{array}{cccc} \\text{saddle} &amp; \\text{saddle} &amp; \\text{saddle} &amp; \\text{saddle} \\\\ \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{red}{\\searrow} &amp; \\color{purple}{\\nearrow}\\\\\\hline \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} &amp; \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} \\end{array} &amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} &amp; \\color{red}{\\searrow} \\\\\\hline \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} &amp; \\color{purple}{\\nearrow} \\end{array} &amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} &amp; \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} \\\\\\hline \\color{purple}{\\nearrow} &amp; \\color{red}{\\searrow} \\end{array} &amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{purple}{\\nearrow}&amp; \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow}\\\\\\hline \\color{red}{\\searrow} &amp; \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} \\end{array} \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{red}{\\searrow} &amp; \\color{gray}{\\swarrow}\\\\\\hline \\color{purple}{\\nearrow} &amp; \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} \\end{array} &amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{purple}{\\nearrow}&amp; \\color{red}{\\searrow} \\\\\\hline \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow}&amp; \\color{gray}{\\swarrow} \\end{array} &amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow}&amp; \\color{purple}{\\nearrow} \\\\\\hline \\color{gray}{\\swarrow}&amp; \\color{red}{\\searrow} \\end{array}&amp; \\begin{array}{c|c} \\color{gray}{\\swarrow}&amp; \\color{blue}{\\nwarrow} \\\\\\hline \\color{red}{\\searrow}&amp; \\color{purple}{\\nearrow} \\end{array}\\\\ \\text{center} &amp; \\text{orbit} &amp; \\text{source} &amp; \\text{orbit} \\end{array}\\] $$ Saddles are unstable, although the trajectory might approach the fixed point at first. A source is unstable; any trajectory heads away from the fixed point. A center is stable; any trajectory heads toward the fixed point. As for the orbits, one in a clockwise direction and the other counter-clockwise, we can’t yet say from this simple theory whether they are stable or unstable. The orbit we have already met, the rabbit-fox dynamics, has counter-clockwise trajectories that form closed loops. This is called neutral stability. Figure 50.5: The rabbit/fox system has orbits that are neutrally stable. 50.2 Linearization For dynamical systems with two state variables, constructing a linear approximation to dynamics near a fixed point follows a similar procedure to that with one-state-variable systems. Locate the fixed point. Construct the first-order polynomial approximation to each of the dynamical functions at the fixed point. For instance, the pendulum system has state variables \\(\\theta\\) and \\(v\\) with dynamics \\[\\partial_t \\theta = g_\\theta(\\theta, v) = v\\\\ \\partial_t v = g_{v}(\\theta, v) = - \\sin(\\theta) \\] There is a fixed point at \\(\\theta = 0\\), \\(v=0\\): this is just the situation of a pendulum hanging down that has no motion. The dynamical function \\(g_\\theta(\\theta, v) = v\\) is already in first-order polynomial form. The other dynamical function, \\(g_v(\\theta, v) = - \\sin(\\theta)\\) is nonlinear. The first order polynomial approximation centered on the fixed point will be \\[g_v(\\theta, v) \\approx \\underbrace{\\color{magenta}{g_{v}(0, 0)}}_0 + \\underbrace{\\color{magenta}{\\partial_\\theta g_v(0, 0)}}_{-\\cos(0)}\\ \\theta + \\underbrace{\\color{magenta}{\\partial_v g_v(0, 0)}}_0\\, v\\] The term \\(g_v(0, 0) = 0\\) because we are evaluating \\(g_v()\\) at a fixed point. The term \\(\\partial_v g_v(0, 0) = 0\\) because \\(g_v()\\) does not depend on \\(v\\). We’ll use \\(u\\) and \\(w\\) as the dynamical variables in the linear approximation in order to avoid confusion with the original, nonlinear equations. The linearized dynamics are therefore: \\[\\partial_t u = \\ \\ w\\\\ \\partial_t w = - u\\] Figure 50.6: Flow field, nullclines, and trajectories of the pendulum (black) and the linearized pendulum ($) from three different initial conditions. 50.3 Exercises D-OFZHG: Draw the nullclines of two dynamical functions on the phase plane using software.

Exercise 50.17: iRZfBY In this exercise, you’ll work with a particular function f() of two variables. Construct the function this way: f &lt;- rfun( ~ x + y, seed=103) The goal of this exercise is to explore the connections between the optimization method of gradient ascent or descent and dynamical systems. Here’s a plot of the function and its gradient field. contour_plot(f(x, y) ~ x + y, domain(x=c(-4, 4), y=c(-4, 4))) %&gt;% gradient_plot(f(x, y) ~ x + y) You can construct the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components of the gradient \\(\\partial_x f(x,y)\\) and \\(\\partial_y f(x,y)\\) of f() this way: dx_f &lt;- D(f(x, y) ~ x) dy_f &lt;- D(f(x, y) ~ y) Use these two functions to define a dynamical system: \\[ \\partial_t x = \\partial_x f(x,y)\\\\ \\partial_t y = \\partial_y f(x,y)\\] Use integrateODE() to integrate the equations numerically from the initial condition \\((x=0, y=-3)\\).

The same is true when it comes to constructing a model of a new phenomenon. You’ll need to decide what are the essential features of the phenomena, how they are connected to one another and how they connect to the question you seek to answer with the model you will eventually build. For painters, there are numerous ways to confront the blank-canvas function. For instance, there are different types of paintings: landscapes, portraits, abstract, and so on. And there are different styles of painting: impressionist, rococo, cubist, art deco, and so on. I don’t think that painters would use this term, but I think of these aids to decision making as a framework, an organization of what you know to guide decision making. Three of the frameworks for modeling that we have worked with in this book might be called: Function shape. Possibilities are hump, sigmoidal, oscillatory, exponential, and so on. We’ve also worked with the low-order polynomial as a function-shape framework, which reduces the decision making to which terms to include in the polynomial. Differential equations. Constructing a model as a differential equation enables the modeler to separate the accounting work of accumulation over time and focus on capturing the relationships that tell, at any instant in time, which way the change will go. In working with this framework, the modeler decides what will be the state variables. Then, the modeler turns to the function shape framework to describe how the state variables themselves determine in which direction the change of each goes. Modeling cycle. Most people are taught that mathematics is about precision, exactitude, and a correct answer. In many settings, this is appropriate. But often the role of mathematics is to provide a language to express ideas about relationships and then to play out the consequences of those ideas. It’s not usually critical that the relationships are being exactly described; observing the calculated consequences from a given statement of the relationships can provide deeper understanding of the system being studied or reveal that the description of the relationships does not lead to realistic consequences and so is incomplete or wrong. Given a choice between a numerical and a symbolic solution to exactly the same problem, the symbolic solution is generally better: it’s exact and it can incorporate parameters symbolically. But don’t fetishize exact solutions. Often, exact solutions exist only for excessively simplified, approximate versions of the system you want to model. It can be reasonable to pay this cost for the purpose of developing a deeper understanding of your model, but in the end you will want a numerical solution to a more accurate model. “Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.” – John Tukey (1915-2000) 51.1 A single state quantity We’ll start with situations that can be modeled with a single state variable. Throughout our examples, we’ll call that state variable \\(S\\), so the differential equation describing how \\(S\\) changes in time will always be \\[\\partial_t S = f(S)\\]. The modeler chooses the shape of \\(f()\\) depending on the situation being modeled. In principle, there is an infinite number of shapes for \\(f(S)\\). But many modeling settings involve behavior that is simple. We’ll work with function shapes where the dynamical function \\(f(S)\\) is continuous and has one or two fixed points. If \\(S\\) is observed to oscillate or to reverse the direction of change, then there must be at least one more state variable, that is, at least one more quantity that changes in time. A single first-order differential equation will not be able to model the situation. If there are no fixed points, then the only possible dynamics are continuous increase in \\(S\\) or continuous decrease in \\(S\\). Often, the point of interest will be whether there is some other factor that changes increase to decrease or vice versa. Again, such situations should be modeled in the context of at least two state variables. Figure 51.1 shows four generic dynamical function shapes where these is one fixed point. The location of the fixed point is, of course, the \\(S_0\\) at which \\(f(S_0)=0\\), that is, the intersection of the function and the blue dashed line. Figure 51.1: Four generic functions shapes with one state variable having one fixed point. The fundamental distinction is between models with stable and models with unstable fixed points. When the situation being modeled has a steady equilibrium, only the stable shapes of \\(f(S)\\) are relevant. A second distinction is between functions with a bounded shape and those with a linear shape. Use a linear shape when you are concerned only with the behavior near the fixed point. But when your model needs to account for behavior far from the fixed point, you need first to have a way to represent what is meant by “far from.” That is represented by the location of the shoulder of the curve relative to the fixed point. A setting for a linear stable model is the cooling or warming of an object to the ambient temperature. \\(S\\) stands for the temperature of the object and the fixed point is the ambient temperature. This model often goes under the name Newton’s Law of Cooling. The prestige of the model name distracts from the fact that this is a very simple model. But in the real world there are likely to be complications that make Newton’s Law imprecise, unlike, say, Newton’s Second Law of Motion which is exact (at non-quantum and non-relativistic scales). For instance, a cup of hot water will cool faster than a cup of cold water. In hot water, evaporation from the surface speeds up the warming. When ice is involved, the rate of temperature change slows when melting or freezing is encountered. Another classic setting for a linear, stable model is radioactive decay. The rate at which the atoms in a mass of a radioactive isotope decay is a constant \\(\\alpha\\) that depends on the nuclear structure. A mass of \\(n\\) atoms will produce \\(\\alpha n\\) individual decay events in a given time interval. But, since each decay event reduces \\(n\\) by 1, the differential equation describing the number of radioactive atoms is \\[\\partial_t n = - \\alpha nt\\] which leads to exponential decay towards zero. Notice that only the \\(0 \\leq n\\) half of the state space is relevant, because the number of atoms can’t be negative. An example of a setting where the bounded stable model applies is one where \\(S\\) stands for the amount of prey or food stock, and there is a constant population of predators who have a limited capacity for eating. Consider, for example, \\(S\\) being the availability of acorns. There might be a fixed population of, say, oaks that produce acorns at a given rate. When predation is low, the acorns accumulate. But when there are a lot of acorns, predators might focus on that bountiful food source. Still, they can only eat so many acorns per day before they are full. Remember that in a differential equation \\(\\partial_t S = f(S)\\), the input to \\(f()\\) is has dimension \\([S]\\), while the output of \\(f()\\) has a different dimension: \\([S]/[t]\\). Thus, in the oak/acorn example above, the output of \\(f()\\) has a dimension corresponding to acorns per day, a rate of consumption. \\(S\\) is acorns, the output of \\(f(S)\\) is acorns per day. The linear unstable model is often used to model population growth. The underlying idea, which might or might not correspond to reality, is that there is a set reproduction rate per member of the population. The differential equation is \\[\\partial_t{S} = a S + c\\] with \\(S\\) being the size of the population. The parameter \\(c\\) captures immigration (\\(0 &lt; c\\)) or emigration (\\(c &lt; 0\\)). To be more detailed, the model can be written as summing a birth process and a death process: \\[\\partial_t S = b S - d S + c\\] where \\(b\\) is the birth rate and \\(d\\) is the death rate. Of course, the detailed model collapses arithmetically to the \\(a S + c\\) model, with \\(a = b - d\\). Still, elaborations on the birth or death processes may include the influence of changing factors. We’ll return to this idea in a bit. Take care to use the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) correctly. The output of \\(f(S) = a S + c\\) must have dimension \\([S]/[t]\\), for instance organisms per hour might be appropriate for bacteria. Thus the individual terms \\(aS\\) and \\(c\\) must have dimenion \\([S]/[t]\\). Consequently, the parameter \\(a\\) has dimension \\(1/[t]\\) as in per hour. That might seem odd until you remember that \\(a\\) is about the creation of new organisms, \\([S]/t\\), per existing organism. Thus the dimension of \\(a\\) is \\([S] / [S][t]\\) which works out to be simply \\(1/[t]\\). Example 51.1 \\(\\ \\) Under ideal reproductive conditions, some bacteria can split in two every 20 minutes. What does this tell us about \\(a\\)? It’s easy to get confused. For instance, a single bacterium that splits every 20 minutes will go from an initial population of \\(S=1\\) at time \\(t=0\\) to a population of \\(S=2\\) at \\(t=\\frac{1}{3}\\) hour to \\(S=4\\) at \\(t=\\frac{2}{3}\\) hour to \\(S=8\\) at \\(t=1\\) hour. This might make it seem that the reproduction rate is 8 per hour. But this calculation of the population size at hour 1 is redundant with the accumulation that will be accomplished in solving the differential equation. The correct way to calculate \\(a\\) from the stated information that there is a split every 20 minutes works like this: The dynamics are \\(\\partial_t S = a S\\). Therefore the solution is \\(S(t) = S_0 e^{a t}\\). According to the given information about splitting, when the initial condition is that \\(S(0) = 1\\), \\[S(1/3) = S_0 e^{a/3} = e^{a/3} = 2\\ .\\] Working from \\(e^{a/3} = 2\\) gives the parameter value we see: \\(a = 3 \\ln(2)\\). For bacteria, the linear unstable model may be realistic for short periods of time, or, more precisely, for as long as the population is small compared to the carrying capacity. (See Section ??/). In contrast, human and other animal populations often have an important age structure, which is just to say that neither a 6 nor a 60 year old person has the same reproduction rate as a 26 year old. Such an age structure calls for a dynamical state with multiple components. But if the environment is steady—no food shortages, no disease, economy unchanging, etc.—it can be reasonable to describe even age-structured populations as a percentage growth per unit time, e.g. percent per year. Realize that such a description is not only about the biology of reproduction, but summarizes the whole system of aging, death, and reproduction. This summary description may no longer be relevant when the system as a whole changes. An example of this in the human population is seen in countries where the number of births per woman has fallen substantially—by half or more—over the time of a generation. Such falls typically accompany a growth in economic wealth and the realization that more resources (e.g. education) needs to be provided to each offspring. A situation where the linear unstable model is realistic involves nuclear decay. Previously, we’ve pointed out that radioactive decay of an isotope is well modeled by the linear stable model. This leads the number of atoms of the radioactive isotope to decay exponentially. But there is an important exception. Some radioactive isotopes are fissile, for instance uranium-233, uranium-235, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241. Fissile materials decay via two different mechanisms. One is each-atom-on-its-own decay that applies generally to radioactive isotopes. The other mechanism involves the decay of one atom triggering the decay of others. The means of triggering involves a sub-atomic particle called a neutron. The decay of a fissile atom releases one or more neutrons, depending on the nuclear structure. If one of these neutrons has the correct energy, and if they collide in the appropriate way with a second fissile atom, that second atom will itself undergo decay, leading to the release of more neutrons. Such a process is called a chain reaction. Typically, a fissile chain reaction takes place inside an engineered device called a reactor. A simple differential equation of a chain reaction can be constructed using the number of neutrons in the reactor, and is \\[\\partial_t N = \\alpha N\\ .\\] As you’ve already seen, the solution to this is \\(N(t) = A e^{\\alpha t}\\): exponential growth. The value of \\(\\alpha\\) is determined by the design of the device. If the device is small, then neutrons can escape from the device before triggering a reaction, so alpha is small. If there are non-fissile neutron absorbers in the device, neutrons are taken out of play so, again, alpha is small and can even be negative. In everyday terms, rapid exponential growth is called an explosion. Exponential growth can’t continue forever, and indeed a fissile bomb blows itself up, resulting in negative \\(\\alpha\\) as the fissile material is scattered. Control of a fission bomb requires a mechanism that changes \\(\\alpha\\) from negative (stable \\(N\\), so no explosion) to positive. This can be accomplished, for instance, by bringing together pieces of fissile material that by themselves has negative \\(\\alpha\\) into a critical mass where \\(\\alpha\\) positive. Non-explosive nuclear reactions, as in power plants, call for a kind of juggling act. The device can’t have negative \\(\\alpha\\) or the reaction would die out exponentially. It can’t have positive \\(\\alpha\\) or the reaction would become explosive. A power reactors is designed to keep \\(\\alpha\\) near zero. Near zero not at zero. The reactor design needs to allow \\(0 &lt; \\alpha\\) to start up the reaction, but trim this down to zero when the reactor is at the desired power. Typically, there is some combination of active and passive mechanisms to provide this capability. An active mechanism is the insertion of “control rods,” which absorb neutrons by reactor operators to make \\(\\alpha &lt; 0\\) when the power generation is higher than desired. Passive mechanisms can involve the transformation of reactor water into steam, which reduces the ability of neutrons to induce new fissile decays. Reactors can be very complicated, however. The explosion of the Soviet Union’s Chernobyl reactor in 1986 was caused by a chain of events that led to control rods being withdrawn beyond the design intentions. Due to the construction of the rods, reinserting the rods to dampen the run-away reaction actually caused the reaction to accelerate. Avoiding such disasters requires a combination of safety oriented design and proper training of the operators. Neither of these were a feature of the 1980s Soviet environment, where secretiveness interfered with proper training and economic motivations to produce were so strong as to encourage widespread cheating. The bounded unstable model is a way to incorporate factors that interfere with sustained exponential growth. Exponential growth requires that the growth rate \\(\\partial_t S\\) increase as \\(S\\) increases: a kind of positive feedback. In the bounded model, the growth rate becomes constant for large \\(S\\). A constant growth rate means that \\(S\\) will grow steadily, that is \\(\\partial_t S = c\\) which has a solution that grows linear in time, as distinct from the exponential solution that results from \\(\\partial_t S = a S\\). An application of the bounded unstable model is seen in the description of micro-organism growth given by Jacques Monod (1910-1976), a Nobel Prize winning biochemist. His idea was that the organisms are reproducing in a kind of sea that has a limited concentration of an essential nutrient, but very large amounts of the nutrient spread out over space. Even though the nutrient is begin consumed by the organisms, more nutrient diffuses in from far away to keep the concentration steady. At large population sizes, the growth rate is nutrient concentration limited, hence constant. In Chapter 14 we introduced the idea of a modeling cycle: taking an initial model, examining the consequence/predictions of that model, and then modifying the model to better correspond to observed reality or new mechanism. A case in point is the linear unstable model for population growth. The linear model is always appropriate near a fixed point. This is just a consequence of the calculus idea that any function can be approximated by a linear function over a small enough domain. In defining derivatives, the question was what constitutes “small enough.” So a linear dynamical function is a good starting point for dynamics near a fixed point. But, as we’ve seen, extending the linear model far from the fixed point leads to population explosion: exponential growth. This can be a valid idea for modeling a pathogen growing in a bowl of room-temperature chicken salad: the pathogen need not consume all the salad to become a threat, so in the domain of interest—human health—the linear model can do the job. But we observe generally that exponential growth does not continue indefinitely. The demographer Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) famously propounded a “principle of population” which held that it is in the nature of populations to growth exponentially until linally limited by famine or disease. He wrote, “[G]igantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the [lack of] food of the world.” Malthus’s model is exponential growth that runs into a wall of limited food. Malthus saw human reproduction as the engine of the immense poverty and suffering of the lower classes in early industrial Britain. This became the basis of an important political dispute, two poles of which are “there’s no point helping the poor, because they create their own poverty,” and “the poverty is due to exploitation, not reproduction.” For us in calculus, there’s a middle road: Malthus’s mathematical model, the unstable linear model, is much too abrupt and narrow minded and can easily be made more realistic. Adding that realism removes the “one mighty blow” from the situation. Let’s add that realism now. Recall the earlier suggestion that the linear unstable model \\(\\partial_t S = a S + c\\) be broken into components: \\[\\partial_t S = \\underbrace{b S}_{\\text{births}} - \\underbrace{d S}_{\\text{deaths}} + \\underbrace{c}_{\\text{immigration}}\\ .\\] Even in Malthus’s time, there were calls to alleviate poverty by encouraging people to leave for less crowded lands: emigration. In the dynamics, emigration corresponds to a negative value for \\(c\\). Making \\(c\\) negative does not do the job on its own. Note that whatever the value of \\(c\\), the dynamics are unstable. Emigration at a constant rate changes the location of the fixed point, but since the dynamics are unstable, growth will still be unbounded. Suppose, however, that government policy sets an emigration goal not as a constant number of people per year but as a constant fraction, \\(eS\\) of the population. Now the dynamics become \\[\\partial_t S = b S - d S - e S\\ .\\] These dynamics are stable or unstable depending on the value of \\(b - (d+e)\\). If that value is negative, the dynamics are stable, if positive, the dynamics are unstable. The situation resembles (mathematically) that of a nuclear power reactor: the control parameter \\(e\\) has to be carefully manipulated to set the population at a fixed level. But there are other things that come into play. One of them is that the parameter setting the death rate, \\(d\\), need not be constant. From Malthus’s perspective, \\(d\\) would change in episodes set by disease and starvation. In Malthus’s era, pandemics were common and wiped out a major fraction of the population in “one mighty blow.” Similarly, starvation plays out on a smaller time scale than reproduction and seems to cut through the population. But the death rate can also be a function of population \\(S\\). For instance, \\(d = d_0 + d_1 S\\) corresponds to a death rate that increases gradually with population size. (The parameters \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) are positive.) Similarly, birth rate can depend on population, that is \\(b = b_0 - b_1 S\\). As the population gets larger, there’s less food and less space, and these changes can reduce the reproduction rate. (The parameters \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are positive.) These models for \\(d\\) and \\(b\\) are simplistic. Why should they have a linear form? The answer is … calculus. Whatever are the functions \\(b(S)\\) and \\(d(S)\\), they must be approximately linear over a small domain. Let’s plug in the refined models for birth and death rates into the population models. We get: \\[\\partial_t S = (b_0 - b_1 S) S - (d_0 + d_1 S) S - e\\ .\\] A little algebraic simplification reduces this to: \\[\\partial_t S = (b_0 - d_0) S - (b_1 + d_1) S^2 - e\\] Whatever are the size of the quantities \\(b_0, b_1, d_0, d_1\\), so long as they are positive, the dynamical function \\(f(S)\\) will have two fixed points, one at small \\(S\\) and the other at large \\(S\\). For small \\(S\\), the fixed point is unstable. The population will grow away from this fixed point. The fixed point at large \\(S\\) will be stable, hence no population explosion. One of the major flaws with the Malthusian viewpoint is that it treated all the dynamical functions as linear, whereas in reality the functions can have a quadratic shape. The classical differential equation for limited population growth, \\[\\partial_t S = a S (1-S/K)\\ ,\\] was introduced by Pierre-François Verhulst in 1838, just four years after Malthus’s death. Another important flaw with Malthus’s model is that it failed to account for the transition from purely agricultural economies to economies that produced large amounts of other goods and services. It turns out as populations grow wealthier, their reproduction rates decrease. With wealth available in non-food terms—clothing, public health, education—reproduction rates can go down even without the “one mighty blow” of starvation and disease. The next section examines both of these factors—the introduction of multiple state variables and the ability to “soften” the explosive unstable linear dynamics with nonlinear corrections—in making subtle models of the behavior of systems. 51.2 Multiple state quantities The previous section examined dynamics of a single state variable. Now we will consider the possibilities when there is a second state variables. It turns out that adding more state variables above two does not introduce many fundamentally new behaviors, so we’ll focus on dynamical systems with two variables. We’ll continue to use capital letters, like \\(S\\), to stand for the state variables. But with two (or more) state variables, we’ll need to give them different names so we can keep tract of what’s doing what to what. The parameters in the dynamical functions will, as has been our practice, be written as lower-case letters, such a, b, r, c, and so on. A starting observation is that for dynamics to be genuinely two-dimensional, the differential equations for the state variables need to be coupled to one another. For example, a dynamical system that nominally has two state variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is: \\[\\partial_t X = f(X)\\\\ \\partial_t Y = g(Y)\\ .\\] The state variables here are not coupled, since the change in each variable depends only on the value of that variable and not on the other. Coupled state variables have dynamics that look like this: \\[\\partial_t X = f(X, Y)\\\\ \\partial_t Y = g(X, Y)\\ .\\] The time evolution of each state variable depends on the other state variable. The most mathematically simple form of coupled dynamics is this: \\[\\partial_t R = a B\\\\ \\partial_t B = c R\\ .\\] What type of real-world setting might such a simple model correspond to? Surprisingly, even this simple model has important things to say about complex phenomena such as love and warfare. We’ll start with warfare, where the signs of the parameters are easy to determine. The model, called Lanchester’s Law, is \\[\\partial_t R = - b B\\\\ \\partial_t B = -r R\\] with both parameters \\(r\\) and \\(b\\) taken to be positive. The state variables \\(R\\) and \\(B\\) stand for the size of the two armies in conflict: the Red army versus the Blue army. As the two armies meet in battle, the Blue army causes casualties in the Red army. These casualties reduce the size of the Red army. Similarly, the Red army causes casualties in the Blue army. The model describes the rate of reduction in the armies as being proportional to the size of the opposing army. But the two armies can be different in their efficiency of causing casualties, reflected by possibly different values of the \\(r\\) and \\(b\\) parameters. The dynamics are not exponential. Exponential decay of the army size would correspond to a model like \\(\\partial_t R = - r R\\), an army fighting itself. But the Lanchester model has \\(\\partial_t R = - b B\\). We’ll defer for a moment finding the trajectories of the state variables in the course of battle. (Hint: in the model, one army wipes out the other.) Instead, we’ll focus on a surprisingly rich implication of of such simple dynamics. Lanchester’s Law has a surprising consequence for measuring the overall strength of a force in a way that combines size (\\(R\\) and \\(B\\)) and effectiveness (\\(r\\) and \\(b\\)) and the implications that has for tactics. Lanchester proposed that the quantity \\[Q(R, B) \\equiv rR^2 - b B^2\\] is a good way to characterize the dynamics. His reasoning was based on a fundamental idea from physics and chemistry: that quantities are conserved. In physics, examples of conserved quantities are energy, momentum, and angular momentum. In chemical reactions, the number of atoms of each species is conserved. It’s hard to say how Lanchester came up with the formula \\(rR^2 - b B^2\\): insight is hard to explain. But we can easily demonstrate that it is conserved, that is, the quantity doesn’t change in time regardless of how the battle proceeds. We’ll do this by showing \\(\\partial_t Q(R, B) = 0\\). \\[\\partial_t Q(R, B) = \\partial_t \\left[\\strut rR^2 - b B^2\\right]\\] Applying the chain rule we find that \\[\\partial_t r R^2 = 2 r R\\, \\partial_t R\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\partial_t b B^2 = 2 b B\\, \\partial_t B\\ .\\] Substituting in \\(\\partial_t R = - b B\\) and \\(\\partial_t B = - r R\\) gives \\[\\partial_t Q(R, B) = - 2 r b R B + 2 b r B R = 0\\ .\\] The conserved quantity \\(Q(R, B)\\) describes an aspect of the battle that goes unchanged over the course of the battle. At any moment, it describes the match between the overall capability of the two armies. That the difference between the capabilities is conserved does not mean the individual capabilities are unchanged in battle. Those capabilities decrease as the army sizes, \\(R\\) and \\(B\\) are reduced. But at any instant in time, the capability of each army is proportional to the square of the army size. change The consequence, is that the capability of each army is, at all times, To illustrate, consider a battle between two armies of archers. The B-army archers are more skilled: they can fire 12 arrows per minute. The R-army archers can fire at only have the rate—6 arrows per minute. But the R army is twice the size of the B army. Are the armies equally matched. It may at first glance seem so, since both armies can fire at the same rate. For instance, if there are 1000 archers in the R army and 500 in the B army, both armies start out capable of firing 6000 arrows per minute. But Lanchester’s Law tells us that the R army is twice as capable as the B army: \\(6 \\times 1000^2\\) is twice as big as \\(12 \\times 500^2\\). To see why the R army is superior, remember that each arrow can take out only one of the opposing archers. For each B arrow that’s on target, the firing rate of R is reduced by 6 arrows per minute. But for each R arrow that hits, the firing rate of B is reduced by 12 arrows per minute. The initial casualty rate for the two armies is the same, but B sees a twice as large reduction in its firing rate. Frederick William Lanchester (1868-1946) was a British engineer, considered one of the greats of British automotive engineering. But that hardly does justice to him. While voyaging across the Atlantic to America, he became captivated by the gliding flight of herring gulls. This led to his development of his circulation theory of flight, a foundation of aerofoil theory. In 1906 he published Aerial Flight containing the first full theory of lift and drag. In Aerodonetics (1908) he developed his phugoid theory of aircraft stability, describing oscillations and stalls. In 1914, Lanchester wrote a book-length series of journal articles that were published in 1916 as Aircraft in Warfare: the Dawn of the Fourth Arm. Imagine trying to theorize about a form of conflict that had never been seen! The difficulty … is that in order to get the future into true perspective, it is necessary to be able to look forward along two parallel lines of development—i.e. to visualize the improvement of aircraft possible in the near future as a matter of engineering development, and simultaneously to form a live conception of what this improvement and evolution will open up in the potentialities of the machine as an instrument of war. (p.3) Mathematician Steven Strogatz proposed in the 1990s that similar equations might be used to describe how love between two people varies over time. Strogatz’s equations are usually written with state variables R and J, standing for Romeo and Juliet. Positive values represent love, negative values are hate. And best to think of the model as a cartoon, but a cartoon that captures some of the behavior seen in reality. To start, let’s consider a form of love that is really more like warfare: \\[\\partial_t R = -j J\\\\ \\partial_t J = - r R \\ .\\] In this pathological relationship, the more Romeo loves Juliet, the faster Juliet’s love decreases toward hate. And vice versa. Imagine that, somehow, these two perverse people started out in love: \\(R(t=0) &gt; 0\\) and \\(J(t=0) &gt; 0\\). As with Lanchester’s Law, both lovers fall increasingly out of love. Depending on the initial intensity of their love and whether or not \\(jJ^2\\) is bigger than \\(rR^2\\) (Lanchester’s conserved quantity), one of the parties will become indifferent, that is, a love level of 0 while the other’s love level is still positive. For the purpose of example, let’s suppose that Juliet is the first to reach indifference. But unlike the warring armies, the love quantity can become negative. As Juliet’s love becomes negative—remember, Romeo still has a positive level of love—then the true perversity of Romeo’s personality becomes apparent. Juliet’s increasing hostility causes Romeo’s love to grow. Without bound, because this is a linear dynamical function. The result is that Juliet’s hate increases even while Romeo’s love increases. But don’t blame Juliet. If Romeo had been the first to reach indifference, Juliet would suffer the unrequited love and Romeo would be villainously hateful. Strangely, if Romeo and Juliet started out mutually hating each other, their personalities would still lead to one having unbounded love for the other, who hates their partner without limit. A mathematically small change in the Romeo-Juliet dynamical system can lead to a profound change in the outcome. For instance, changing one sign, as in \\[\\partial_t R = r J\\\\ \\partial_t J = - j J\\ ,\\] produces, as we’ll see, a never-ending cycle of alternating love/hate. The two dynamical functions in the previous examples, \\(-r R\\) and \\(-j J\\) are low-order polynomials. A sensible human being might suggest that the constant term in the polynomials should be added, but the cold, analytic mind of the mathematician would see that this would only change the location of the fixed point and not its stability. That suggests that the next more complicated model to consider involves includes both variables in the dynamical function. Like this: \\[\\partial_t R = a R + b J\\\\ \\partial_t J = c R + d J\\ ,\\] where the coefficients \\(a, b, c, d\\) might be either positive or negative depending on the personality of the lovers. Analysis of this model will have to await the introduction of new mathematical tools in Chapter 53. Whether Strogatz’s love model is realistic or not, it does illustrate a basic idea of model building: start with simple dynamical functions, check out their consequences, then modify the dynamical functions. We’re going to do this now, with the modifications being purely mathematical along the lines of including different terms in low-order polynomial approximations and considering positive and negative coefficients. As you’ll see, the simple models correspond to a surprisingly wide range of behaviors. 51.3 Classical phase-plane models We have been using the term state space to refer to the set of possible values for the state variables. When there is only one state variable, the state space corresponds to the number line, or perhaps just the positive half of the number line. When there are two state variables, the state space corresponds to the coordinate plane; any point in the plane is a legitimate state for the system. Historically, another term is used for the two-variable state space: the phase plane. This is just a matter of terminology, but it is so prevalent that you will occasionally see it mentioned. We don’t use it since dynamical systems can have a state space that is 1, 2, 3, or higher dimensional, but the phrase “phase plane” only works for 2-dimensional state spaces. In this section, we’ll look at some famous models that involve two state variables. Out of respect for history, we’ll call these “classical phase plane” models, but this is entirely equivalent to saying “classical dynamical models with two state variables.” Our purpose in studying these classical models is two-fold: to show how simple models can make it easier to draw out the consequences of the mechanisms that we think are at work in real-world systems; and to show you how modifications to purely linear models can produce dynamics that are realistic even away from fixed points. To start, let’s return to the Rabbit-Fox dynamics models. Classically this is called the predator-prey model. It’s also called the “Lotka-Volterra” model in honor of it’s inventors: American biophysicist Alfred Lotka (1880-1949) and Italian mathematical physicist Vito Volterra (1860-1940). The two first-order differential equations in the Lotka-Volterra model are \\[\\partial_t R = \\alpha R - \\beta F R\\\\ \\partial_t F = \\delta F R - \\gamma F\\] each of which contains a linear term (\\(\\alpha R\\) in the \\(R\\) equation, \\(\\gamma F\\) in the F equation). Each equation also contains an interaction term. Here, the mathematical/statistical name for the product of two quantities corresponds nicely with the physical reality that the terms describe what happens to rabbits when they interact with a fox, and similarly what happens to foxes. The parameters \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\), and \\(\\delta\\) can, mathematically, be either positive or negative, but they make sense in terms of rabbits and foxes only if all of them are positive. So the “interaction” is always negative for the rabbits and positive for the foxes. Rewriting the model provides a bit of insight: \\[\\partial_t R \\ = \\underbrace{(\\alpha - \\beta F)}_{k_R} R\\\\ \\ \\\\ \\partial_t F = \\ \\underbrace{(-\\gamma + \\delta R)}_{k_F} F\\ . \\] Think about the \\(k_R\\) and \\(k_F\\) terms as the reproduction rates. If the fox population were constant, then the rabbit dynamics would be exponential growth or decay, depending on the sign of \\(k_R = \\alpha - \\beta F\\). Similarly, if the rabbit population were constant, the fox dynamics would be exponential decay or growth, depending on the sign of \\(k_F = -\\gamma + \\delta R\\). The two equations are coupled so that the rabbit population alternating between growth and decay leads the fox population to so alternate, and vice versa. 51.4 Epidemic In a communicable disease, such as COVID-19, the infectious agent is transmitted from an infective person to another person who is susceptible. The time course of an epidemic can be modeled simply with two state variables. We’ll let \\(S(t)\\) be the number of susceptible people and \\(I(t)\\) the number of infective people at any time \\(t\\). The dynamics of the \\(S\\) variable can be simple: \\(S\\) changes when an infective person meets (interacts with!) a susceptible person. That susceptible person, with some probability, becomes infective. So \\[\\partial_t S = -\\beta S I\\ .\\] The dynamics of the \\(I\\) variable are a just a little more complicated. First, every person who is converted from susceptible to infective becomes a new infective. This is the \\(\\beta S I\\) term in the following differential equation. Second, infectives gradually recover. This is often modeled as a simple \\(-\\alpha I\\) term. \\[\\partial_t I = \\beta S I - \\alpha I\\] This is famously called the SIR model, standing for the susceptible, infective, recovered chain of events. In the model, recovery means “no longer able to infect.” Thus, a person who has been isolated is considered “recovered,” whether or not they display symptoms of the disease. We usually think of recover in terms of a time span, for instance taking a week to recover. But \\(\\alpha I\\) doesn’t work this way. To see why, consider the situation starting on the day that there are no more infective people, that is, \\(S=0\\). The dynamics from this day forward are simplified: \\(\\partial_t I = =\\alpha I\\). Of course, the solution to this simplified differential equation is \\(I(t) = I_0 e^{-\\alpha t}\\); the size of the infective group gets smaller exponentially. Figure 51.2 compares what \\(I(t)\\) would look like if it takes, say, one week to recover and what \\(I(t)\\) looks like under the model’s \\(\\partial_t I = =\\alpha I\\) dynamics. Figure 51.2: Comparing \\(I(t)\\) for the “takes a week to recover” model and the \\(\\partial_t I = -\\alpha I\\) model. To show the dynamics of the SIR model, we need to propose numerical values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). This is not a trivial matter if the goal is to match the dynamics to a particular disease and size of population. For our purposes here, we’ll imagine that \\(S(0) = 0.999\\) and \\(I(0) = 0.001\\), which is to say we are looking at the proportion of the population that is susceptible or infective. Figure ?? shows the flow field for \\(\\beta = 1/2\\) and \\(\\alpha = 1/7\\).

She rented a car that has not only “cruise control” (a technology from the 1970s that holds a constant speed without driver intervention) but also “car following,” that keeps the car a set distance \\(D\\) behind the car in front. Your cousin, knowing that you are a CalcZ student, asks you how the “car following” system works. First, define some terms. You tell your cousin to denote the current, instantaneous distance from the car ahead as \\(\\xi\\). You point out that when \\(\\xi - D &gt; 0\\), you’re a greater distance than \\(D\\) from the car ahead and therefore the velocity should be increased so you catch up. On the other hand, when you’re too close (\\(\\xi &lt; D\\)) you should decrease your velocity. The car-following system automates this, the relationship being \\(\\partial_t \\xi = b (\\xi - D)\\). Your cousin has never encountered a name like \\(\\xi\\) so you decide to simplify. “Let \\(x = \\xi - D\\), so \\(x\\) is positive if you are too far behind, zero when you’re at the right distance, and negative if you are too far ahead.” Conveniently \\(\\partial_t x = \\partial_t \\xi\\), so you can write down the automatic relationship in terms of \\(x\\): \\(\\partial_t x = b x\\) with \\(b\\) a positive number, such as 1. Question A Where is the fixed point of the dynamics \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x\\)? \\(x=D\\)︎✘ No, it should be \\(\\xi=D\\), which means that \\(x=0\\). \\(x=0\\)Excellent!  \\(\\xi = 0\\)︎✘ This corresponds to zero distance between you and the car in front of you. Not what we want! There’s no fixed point.︎✘ Question B Is the fixed point of \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x\\) (with \\(b &gt; 0\\)) stable? Yes, that’s why we can leave it to the automatic system.︎✘ True, we would want the automatic system to show stable fixed point behavior, but that’s not what’s happening here. No, the solution grows exponentially as \\(e^{bt}\\).Nice!  Yes, the solution decays exponentially as \\(e^{bt}\\)︎✘ But since \\(b &gt; 0\\), this wouldn’t be exponential decay but growth. Something’s wrong with the system you’ve sketched out. You want a stable following distance, doing the right thing if the car ahead speeds up or slows down, but your system is unstable. Question C Which of the following rules will have a stable fixed point at \\(x=0\\)? \\(\\partial_t\\, x = -b x\\) (with \\(b &gt; 0\\))Correct.  \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b^2 x\\)︎✘ The coefficient on \\(x\\) is still positive, so this system is unstable. \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x^2\\)︎✘ This system is stable for disturbances that make \\(x &lt; 0\\), but unstable for disturbances that make \\(x &gt; 0\\). \\(\\partial_t\\, x = 0 x\\)︎✘ In this system, \\(x\\) doesn’t change. The word “feedback” is used to describe systems where the change in the state is a function of the state. “Negative feedback” is when the change is negative when the state is positive, as in \\(\\partial_t\\, x = -b\\, x\\). Negative feedback is desirable when you want to keep things stable. “Positive feedback” is when the change is the same sign as the state, as in \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b\\, x\\) and makes things unstable. Exercise 51.XX: BbcPyk Here are three different first-order differential equations with fixed points at \\(x^\\star = 0\\) and \\(x^\\star=1\\). \\(\\partial_t x = g_1(x) \\equiv x (1-x)\\) \\(\\partial_t x = g_2(x) \\equiv 0.25 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\) \\[\\partial_t x = g_3(x) \\equiv \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} x &amp; x &lt; 0.18\\\\ 0.18 &amp; 0.18 \\leq x \\leq 0.82\\\\ 1 -x &amp; 0.82 &lt; x \\end{array}\\right.\\] The \\(g_i()\\) functions are graphed below. A. For each of the equations, match the number (i, ii, iii) to the color (magenta, blue, black). Comment on the differences in shape among them. B. Integrate each of the differential equations from initial condition \\(x_0 = 0.01\\). Compare the time series plots. Do the dynamics of \\(g_3()\\) product a similar or radically different time series than \\(g_1()\\) and \\(g_2()\\)? Comment: Usually, many different mathematical functions can be used to model a given phenomenon. The different functions will have similar shapes, but do not need to be identical. Exercise 51.XX: trcQuC Lewis Fry Richardson (1881-1953) was an English scientist who worked in many areas, including weather prediction. (See Block 1.) This problem concerns a model Richardson built to account for arms races between countries. In the model, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) respectively refer to the size of the military of the two countries. The equations model how the size of the militaries change in time: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\dot{x} &amp; = &amp; a y - m x + r\\\\ \\dot{y} &amp; = &amp; b x - n y + s\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The terms \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) represent the basic grievances between the two countries. The parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent “fear,” that is, the extent to which one country feels the need to build up arms in response to the other country’s arms. The parameters \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are about the internal dynamics of the country: its ability/desire to sustain a large military. Question A What should the signs of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) be if the countries have substantial grievances against each other?     positive\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       negative︎✘        zero︎✘ Question B What should be the signs of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), given that they represent “fear?”     positive\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       negative︎✘        zero︎✘ Question C What should be the signs of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), in a country which, on its own, would not like to build a large military? Note the sign preceeding these terms.     positive\\(\\heartsuit\\ \\)       negative︎✘        zero︎✘ Depending on the values of the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\), the Richardson dynamics can produce different outcomes. Two of the previous three plots show Richardson Arms Race dynamics for two mutually fearful countries with mutual grievances, Freedonia and Jockavia. The third plot does not; the signs of one of the coefficients has been reversed and so the dynamics don’t make sense for modeling an arms race. In each of the three plots, start from initial point \\(x=2,y=1\\), that is, a situation where Freedonia is more armed than Jackavia, and trace out the trajectory over time. For each of the three plots, find any equilibrium point and say whether it is stable or unstable. If there is no equilibrium, move on. Identify which of the three plots is NOT the Richardson dynamics. In the non-Richardson flow, which coefficient has been reversed: it’s one of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), or \\(s\\).

(See Figure 51.2.) Find a value of \\(\\alpha\\) such that the expectation value of the time to recovery is 7 days. To do this: Find a formula for the function \\(I(t)\\) from the differential equation. Guess an appropriate value for \\(\\alpha\\). Construct the appropriate integral using \\(I(t)\\) to find the expectation value of \\(t\\). (See Chapter 35.) Modify your guess for \\(\\alpha\\) until the expectation value comes out to 7. ## # A tibble: 1 × 2 ## t .output. ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.378 -0.00000187 ```&lt;/details&gt; EXERCISE: Lanchester&#39;s Laws: Show that the conserved quantity is indeed conserved: **Question A** Calculate $\\partial_t r R^2$.

END OF EXERCISE EXERCISE * Newton’s Law of Cooling is about how a hot (or cold) object comes into equilibrium with the ambient temperature.

That may seem strange; a building doesn’t move (we hope!), an airplane stays in steady flight, the seasons have been steady in their progression for as long as records have been kept. And yet … a building might be shaken and even destroyed by an earthquake, airplanes require pilots and control systems for steady flight. Even satellites in far Earth orbit can drift from their desired positions and attitudes and require control corrections. A system is said to be in steady state when it stays put, unchanging. Another term often used to express such constancy is equilibrium which occurs when the various forces or processes acting on the system balance out. In the language of dynamical systems, the equilibrium state of a system is called a fixed point. Mathematically, this is a coordinate in the state space where all the right-hand sides of the differential equations equal zero. For a two-dimensional system with dynamics \\[\\partial_t x = f(x, y)\\\\\\partial_t y = g(x,y)\\ ,\\] a fixed point will be a particular value for the state which we’ll write as \\((x^\\star, y^\\star)\\) where both \\(f(x^\\star, y^\\star) = 0\\) and \\(g(x^\\star, y^\\star) = 0\\). An important vocabulary word in dynamics is transient. In everyday speech, this means something like “just passing through.” It’s the same in dynamics: that part of the trajectory which precedes stable, fixed behavior such as at a fixed point. Transients occur whenever a dynamical system has an initial state not on a stable, fixed state. They are also common in systems that are disrupted by some external force, for example in the recovery of an electrical power distribution grid after a disturbance such as an ice storm. After a sharp bang, the ringing in your ears is a transient. When you stand up too suddenly, the “stars” you see are a transient due to diminished blood flow. Turn on an oven? The transient is the warming up until the oven reaches the temperature setting. Although transients are … well, transient, they can be very important. Key to the Wright Brothers success was their recognition that air turbulence elicits transients in attitude and that aircraft need control systems that can work fast enough for the craft to survive the transient. If you have driven a car with a broken suspension, you’ll know that it can be hard to control after the transient caused by hitting a bump in the road. Small disturbances often elicit transients that decay away exponentially. Such transients, like all exponentially decaying processes, can be characterized by a half life: the time it takes the transient to shrink to half its original value. (Not all transients decay exponentially, but that’s a story for another course.) In this chapter, we’ll study the quantitative response to dynamical systems with a fixed point when the state is perturbed by some outside force. Our focus will be on linear or linearized dynamical functions, which are generally an excellent description of dynamics near a fixed point. 52.1 One state variable Linear systems with one state variable have simple dynamics: \\[\\partial_t y = k y\\] which has a fixed point at \\(y^\\star = 0\\). Even dynamics like \\(\\partial_t x = k x + b\\) can be easily transformed into this simple form; the fixed point is \\(x^\\star = - b/a\\) and defining \\(y \\equiv x - x^\\star\\) gives the \\(\\partial_t y = k y\\) form. The solution is also simple: \\(y(t) = y_0\\ e^{kt}\\), where \\(y_0\\) is the initial condition on \\(y\\). If the parameter \\(k &lt; 0\\), the dynamics are exponential decay to the fixed point. If \\(0 &lt; k\\), the dynamics are exponential growth away from the fixed point. 52.2 Two state variables If the state variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are measured with respect to a fixed point, the differential equation of the linear or linearized system is: \\[\\partial_t x = a x + b y\\\\ \\partial_t y = c x + d y\\] Exponentials are an important form of ansatz for linear differential equations. To show why, let’s review the solution to \\(\\partial_t x = k x\\), but assume that all we know is that the solution is an exponential function of time: \\(x(t) = A e^{\\lambda t}\\) and that we don’t yet know the parameters \\(A\\) or \\(\\lambda\\). As usual for an ansatz, we plug it into both sides of the differential equation, giving \\[\\partial_t A e^{\\lambda t} = k A e^{\\lambda t}\\ \\ \\implies \\lambda A e^{\\lambda t} = k A e^{\\lambda t}\\ \\ \\implies \\lambda = k\\ .\\] Now we know the value of \\(\\lambda\\). What about \\(A\\)? Evaluate the solution at \\(t=0\\). This gives \\(x(0) = A e^{\\lambda 0} = A\\). So we know \\(A\\) is the initial condition \\(x(0)\\) (which we usually abbreviate \\(x_0\\)). We’ll try the same approach with the two-state variable system, but we’ll start with a special case where some of the parameters \\(a, b, c\\), and \\(d\\) are zero. \\[\\require{cancel}\\text{Simplification:}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\begin{array}{l}\\partial_t x = \\cancel{ax} + b y\\\\\\partial_t y =\\ c x + \\cancel{dy}\\end{array}\\ .\\] We’re going to modify the equations a little, specifically, we’ll take the derivative with respect to time of both sides of the top equation, giving: \\[\\partial_{tt} x = b\\, \\partial_{t\\ }y\\\\ \\partial_{t\\ } y = c\\, x \\] Substitute in the value for \\(\\partial_t y\\) from the bottom equation to get a single, second-order differential equation: \\[ \\partial_{tt} x = b\\, c\\, x\\ .\\] Plug in the usual ansatz, \\(x(t) = A e^{\\lambda t}\\) to get \\[\\lambda^2 A e^{\\lambda t} = b\\,c\\, A e^{\\lambda t}\\ \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ \\ \\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut b\\,c}\\] The \\(\\pm\\) is the interesting part here. If, say, \\(b=1\\) and \\(c=1\\), there are two values for \\(\\lambda\\) that will be consistent with the differential equation: \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -1\\). Either of these will produce a solution that satisfies the differential equation: \\(x_1(t) = A e^{\\lambda_1 t}\\) or \\(x_2(t) = B e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\). So which of the two possibilities is it? Since everything about the differential equation is linear, any linear combination of the two possibilities will also satisfy the equation. So we can conclude that \\[x(t) = A e^{\\lambda_1 t} + B e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\ .\\] What are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)? That depends on the initial condition. Evaluate both sides of the equation at \\(t=0\\) to get \\[x(0) = A e^{\\lambda_1 0}+ B e^{\\lambda_2 t} = A + B\\ .\\] At this point, you need to look back at the original system of equations. There are two state variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and therefore we need to specify two components of the initial condition. If \\(x(0)\\) is interpreted as the initial position, then following the example of the pendulum we can look to the velocity \\(\\partial_t x\\) as the second component of the initial condition. From \\(x(t)\\) we can easily calculate the velocity: \\[\\partial_t x(t) = \\lambda_1 A e^{\\lambda_1 t} + \\lambda_2 B e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\ .\\] Again, evaluate this at \\(t=0\\) to get a second equation for the initial condition the pair \\[\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_t x(0) = \\lambda_1 A + \\lambda_2 B\\\\x(0) = \\ \\ A \\ \\ + \\ B\\\\\\end{array}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ \\ \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_1 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\lambda_2\\\\1 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{C}A\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{C}x(0)\\\\ \\partial_t x(0)\\end{array}\\right] .\\] From Block 5, we know how to solve such matrix equations. So, given the initial values \\(x(0)\\) and \\(\\partial_t x(0)\\), we can find an exact, quantitative solution to the differential equation. Example 52.1 \\(\\ \\) Let’s look at the flow field, some trajectories and their time series for the system \\[\\partial_t x = b y\\\\\\partial_t y = c x\\] for \\(b=1\\) and \\(c=2\\). Figure 52.1: Three trajectories from the system \\[\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_t x = y\\\\\\partial_t y = 2 x\\end{array}\\] Each of these trajectories starts out by heading toward the fixed point at (0,0). Then, each turns and heads away toward \\(\\pm \\infty\\) from the fixed point, Figure 52.2: The time series \\(x(t)\\) for the three different trajectories in Figure 52.1. Each of the time series is similar, first showing exponential decay toward 0 then exponential growth toward \\(\\pm \\infty\\). The initial conditions for the black and \\(\\color{magenta}{\\text{magenta}}\\) trajectories are very similar. You can imagine a trajectory starting between those initial conditions that would go down the middle of the “trumpet.” This trajectory would be exponential decay toward 0, but would be hard to see since \\(x=0, y=0\\) is an unstable fixed point (a saddle). The initial condition for the black trajectory is \\(x(0)=0.72\\) and \\(y(0)=\\partial_t x(0) = -1\\), while for the \\(\\color{magenta}{\\text{magenta}}\\) trajectory it is \\(x(0)=0.70\\) and \\(y(0)=\\partial x(0) = -1\\). Let’s find each trajectory as a separate linear combination \\(A e^{\\lambda_1 t} + B e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\). The equations to solve are \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1 \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\\\\\lambda_1 \\ \\ \\lambda_2\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c}A\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}x(0)\\\\ \\partial_t x(0)\\end{array}\\right] .\\] By plugging in the parameters \\(a=0\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=2\\), \\(d=0\\) in the dynamical functions, we find that \\[\\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut 2} \\approx \\pm 1.4142 \\ .\\] Therefore, we solve \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.4142 \\ \\ \\ -1.4142\\\\1 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c}A\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_t\\,x(0)\\\\x(0)\\end{array}\\right] .\\] M &lt;- cbind(rbind(1.4142, 1), rbind(-1.4142,1)) b_black = rbind(-1, 0.72) b_magenta = rbind(-1, 0.70) qr.solve(M, b_black) ## [,1] ## [1,] 0.006443219 ## [2,] 0.713556781 qr.solve(M, b_magenta) ## [,1] ## [1,] -0.003556781 ## [2,] 0.703556781 The two trajectories are therefore \\[x_\\text{black}(t) = 0.0064 e^{1.4142 t} + 0.7136 e^{-1.4142}\\\\ \\color{magenta}{x_\\text{magenta}(t)} = -0.00356 e^{1.4142 t} + 0.70356 e^{-1.4142 t}\\] For both trajectories, the initial amplitude of the decaying exponential is much larger than for the growing exponential. That’s why the time series decay toward zero initially. But as \\(t\\) grows, the exponential growth become much more important. For the black trajectory, the exponential growth has a positive coefficient, so the growth is toward \\(\\infty\\). But for the \\(\\color{magenta}{\\text{magenta}}\\) trajectory, the exponential growth as a negative coefficient, thus that trajectory grows toward \\(-\\infty\\). The method we used to solve the simplified problem also works for the original problem \\[\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_t x = ax + b y \\\\ \\partial_t y = c x + dy\\end{array}\\ .\\] Step 1: Differentiate with respect to \\(t\\) both sides of the top equation, giving \\[\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_{tt} x = a\\, \\partial_t x + b\\, \\partial_t y\\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\partial_t y = c x \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ + dy\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{array}\\ .\\] Step 2: Use the second equation to substitute for \\(\\partial_t\\, y\\) in the top equation, giving \\[\\partial_{tt} x = a \\partial_t x + b\\left(\\strut c x + dy\\right) = a\\, \\partial_t x + b\\, c\\, x + b\\, d\\, y\\] Step 3: One more substitution. From the original top equation, we know \\[y = \\frac{\\partial_t x - a x}{b}\\ .\\] Plug this in for \\(y\\) in the result from Step 2, giving \\[\\partial_{tt} x = a\\, \\partial_t x + b\\, c\\, x + b\\, d\\, \\frac{\\partial_t x - a x}{b} = \\left(\\strut a + d\\right)\\ \\partial_t x + \\left(\\strut b c - a d\\right)\\] Step 4: Use the ansatz \\(x(t) = e^{\\lambda t}\\). This produces \\[\\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t}= (a + d) \\lambda e^{\\lambda t}+ \\left(\\strut bc - ad\\right)e^{\\lambda t} \\ \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ \\lambda^2 = (a + d) \\lambda + \\left(\\strut bc - ad\\right)\\] which can be solved for \\(\\lambda\\): \\[\\lambda = \\left(a + d\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(a - d\\right)^2 + 4 b c}\\] Again, the \\(\\pm\\) is the interesting bit here. There are two simple solutions that satisfy the differential equation: \\(x_1(t) = e^{\\lambda_1 t}\\) and \\(x_2(t) = e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\). In addition, any linear combination \\(A e^{\\lambda_ t} + B e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\) of these simple solutions will satisfy the differential equations. Once we know \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\), the situation is identical to the simplified version. Again, knowing the initial condition \\(x(0)\\) and \\(\\partial_t x(0)\\) allows us to find the coefficients in the linear combination by solving the matrix equation \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\\\\\lambda_1 \\ \\ \\ \\lambda_2\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{C}A\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{C}x(0)\\\\ \\partial_t x(0)\\end{array}\\right] .\\] MAYBE SHOW THAT the vectors and time constants can be calculated using eigen()? "],["eigenvalues.html", "Chapter 53 Eigenvalues, eigenvectors 53.1 Vector solutions to linear differential equations 53.2 Eigenvectors and eigenvalues 53.3 Exercises", " Chapter 53 Eigenvalues, eigenvectors In the previous chapters, you’ve seen how linear dynamics, when unstable, lead trajectories off to infinity. Chapter 51 looked at some ways that nonlinearity can tame instability, as in the simple models of linear growth. In this chapter, we return to linear dynamics to develop a quantitative theory of stability. Such theory is important in many engineering and design applications. For instance, a building exposed to earthquake risk can be economically designed to be strong specifically against the type of shaking produced by earthquakes. An electronic circuit can be designed to be sensitive to certain kinds of communication signals while still resisting noise or jamming. Example 53.1 Cruise control is a feature of many modern automobiles. It enables a driver to set a desired speed for the car to follow automatically, thus reducing cognitive load on the driver. Early models of cruise control introduced in the 1970s (and still common in 2020) had an extremely simple logic. The speedometer constantly monitors the car’s speed \\(v\\). The driver sets a desired speed, which we’ll call \\(v_0\\). The cruise control actuator—the mechanism that works to maintain the speed at \\(v_0\\) by, let’s say, adjusting the throttle to increase or reduce speed as appropriate—is designed to produce a throttle input proportional to the deviation in actual speed \\(v\\) from the set speed \\(v_0\\). \\[\\text{throttle_input} = -a (v - v_0)\\ .\\] You can see that when \\(v = v_0\\), the throttle input from the system is zero. When \\(v_0 &lt; v\\), as when starting to go downhill, the throttle input will be negative, reducing the speed. A simple model is that the throttle input is proportional to \\(\\partial_t\\, v\\): positive input increases speed, negative input decreases speed. The overall system is then described by a linear, first-order differential equation \\[\\partial_t\\,v = -a(v-v_0)\\ .\\] This equation has a fixed point at \\(v = v_0\\) (as desired). To describe more simply the dynamics around the fixed point, we can define a new dynamical state \\(y=v - v_0\\). Differentiating both sides with respect to time gives \\(\\partial_t y = \\partial_t v\\), so we can re-write the original differential equation as \\[\\partial_t y = -a y\\] which has a solution \\(y(t) = A e^{-at}\\) as we’ve seen before. For any positive coefficient \\(a\\), the control system is stable: a deviation from \\(v_0\\) will be followed by exponential decay back to \\(v_0\\). A modern cruise control system adds an important feature: the car slows down automatically if it gets too close to the car in front. Let’s call the distance to the leading car \\(x\\) and define “too close” to mean closer than distance \\(x_0\\). The car is travelling at velocity \\(v\\) and the car in front at \\(v_f\\). If \\(v_f &lt; v\\), the distance between the cars gets smaller: \\(\\partial_t x = -(v - v_f)\\). On the other hand, if \\(x_0 &lt; x\\), the car is far enough away that the velocity can be increased: \\(\\partial_t v = b(x - x_0)\\). We can unite these two first-order differential equations into a single, second-order equation: \\[\\partial_t x = -(v - v_f) \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\partial_{tt} x = - \\partial_t v = - b(x-x_0)\\] To solve this system, define \\(y \\equiv x - x_0\\). This implies \\(\\partial_{tt} y = \\partial_{tt} x\\), so the equation describing the control system becomes \\[\\partial_{tt} y = - b y\\ .\\] The solution to this is \\(y(t) = A \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{b} \\ t\\right)\\) as you can confirm by substitution. Result: The simple car-following control system oscillates. That’s not a very good experience for the driver! By constructing a theory of stability, we may be able to figure out a re-design that will cause the oscillations to go away. 53.1 Vector solutions to linear differential equations The form in which we have been writing linear differential equations in two state variables is \\[\\partial_t x = a x + b y\\\\ \\partial_t y = c x + d y\\] A key part of constructing a theory of stability is finding a set of mathematical ideas that enable us to view dynamics in a simpler way. The idea we will introduce here is thinking about the state and trajectory of a differential equation in terms of vectors. We’ll work here with systems with a two-variable dynamical state, but the results apply just as well to higher dimensional states. That’s important in applied work, where the systems being modeled are complicated with many state components. We can re-write the linear differential equation using vector and matrix notation. Suppose that we collect the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components of the state into a vector, \\[\\vec{w(t)} =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x(t)\\\\y(t)\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\] The differential equation, in terms of \\(\\vec{w(t)}\\) is \\[\\partial_t \\vec{w(t)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d\\end{array}\\right] \\vec{w(t)}\\ .\\] Now imagine that we pick two non-colinear vectors, \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) that span the state space. Since the vectors are assumed to span the state, any initial condition can be written as a linear combination of those two vectors: \\[\\vec{w(0)} =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x(0)\\\\y(0)\\end{array}\\right] = m_1 \\vec{u_1} + m_2 \\vec{u_2}\\ .\\] For the moment, we won’t worry about how best to choose \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\); any two vectors that are not colinear will do. Example 53.2 \\(\\ \\) As a running example, we’ll work with the pair of first-order differential equations \\[\\partial_t x = x + y\\\\ \\partial_t y = 2 x \\ \\ \\ \\ \\] which, in vector/matrix form are \\[\\partial_t \\vec{w(t)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right] \\vec{w(t)}\\ .\\] Imagine that we choose, arbitrarily, \\[\\vec{u_1} = \\color{magenta}{\\left[\\begin{array}{r}1\\\\-3\\end{array}\\right]}\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\vec{u_2} = \\color{blue}{\\left[\\begin{array}{r}1.0\\\\0\\end{array}\\right]}\\ .\\] For the example, we’ll calculate a trajectory starting at the initial condition \\(\\vec{w(0)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{r}-1.1\\\\ 2.1\\end{array}\\right]\\): traj &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x + y, dy ~ 2*x, x=-1.1, y=2.1, tdur=2) traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj) Figure 53.1: The trajectory calculated starting at (-1.1, 2.1). The graph is annotated with the vectors \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) and the flow field. The initial condition (marked “0” in Figure 53.1) is, like any other point in the state space, a linear combination of \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\). We can find the scalar coefficients of the linear combination using any of the methods presented in Block 5, for instance the telescope method. We’ll illustrate with qr.solve(): M &lt;- cbind(rbind(1,-3), rbind(1,0)) w0 &lt;- rbind(-1.1, 2.1) qr.solve(M, w0) ## [,1] ## [1,] -0.7 ## [2,] -0.4 So, \\(\\vec{w(0)} = -0.7 \\vec{u_1} - 0.4 \\vec{u_2}\\). Keep these scalar coefficients, \\(-0.7\\) and \\(-0.4\\) in mind for the next example. We can use integrateODE() to find the solution starting at any initial condition. In particular, we can find the solution \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) as the initial condition and, similarly, using \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) as the initial condition. traj_u1 &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x + y, dy ~ 2*x, x=1, y=-3, tdur=2) traj_u2 &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x + y, dy ~ 2*x, x=1, y= 0, tdur=2) Figure 53.2 shows these trajectories. Figure 53.2: Trajectories from the initial conditions \\(\\color{magenta}{\\vec{u_1}}\\) and \\(\\color{blue}{\\vec{u_2}}\\). At first glance, the two trajectories \\(\\vec{u_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2(t)}\\) in Figure ?? that start from \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) might not look much like the trajectory in Figure 53.1 that starts from \\(\\vec{w(0)} = -0.7 \\vec{u_1} - 0.4 \\vec{u_2}\\). But in fact there is a very simple relationship between the trajectories: \\[\\vec{w(t)} = -0.7 \\vec{u_1(t)} - 0.4 \\vec{u_2(t)}\\ .\\] To state the situation more generally, any solution to the differential equations can be written as a linear combination of the solutions starting at \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\), regardless of how \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) were chosen. We can see this algebraically. Since \\(\\vec{u_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2(t)}\\) are solutions to the linear differential equation, it must be that \\[\\partial_t \\vec{u_1(t)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right] \\vec{u_1(t)}\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\partial_t \\vec{u_2(t)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right] \\vec{u_2(t)}\\ .\\] Taking a linear combination of these equations gives \\[\\partial_t \\left[m_1\\, \\vec{u_1(t)} + m_2 \\vec{u_2(t)}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right] \\left[m_1\\, \\vec{u_1(t)} + m_2 \\vec{u_2(t)}\\right]\\] The same will be true in general, that is, for the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d\\end{array}\\right]\\). 53.2 Eigenvectors and eigenvalues In the previous section, we saw that the solution to any linear differential equation starting at any initial condition can be written as a linear combination \\(m_1 \\vec{u_1(t)} + m_2 \\vec{u_2(t)}\\), where \\(\\vec{u_1(t)}\\) is the solution starting at an initial condition \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2(t)}\\) is the solution starting at \\(\\vec{u_2}\\). It does not matter how \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) are chosen, so long as they are not colinear, that is, so long as they span the state space. In this section, we’ll demonstrate that there is a particular way of selecting \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2}\\) that makes the solutions \\(\\vec{u_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\vec{u_2(t)}\\) have a very simple, purely exponential format. The vectors to be chosen are the eigenvectors of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d\\end{array}\\right]\\). We’ll call these eigenvectors \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_2}\\). (This use of the Greek letter \\(\\Lambda\\) (capital “lambda”) and it’s lower-case version \\(\\lambda\\), is conventional in mathematics, physics, and engineering. So it’s worth learning to identify the letters.) Our task in this section is to show how to compute the eigenvectors \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_2}\\) and that the solutions \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_2(t)}\\) are in fact simple exponentials. In Chapter 54 we’ll derive the formula for the eigenvectors. Here, we’ll use the R function eigen() to do the calculations for us. Example 53.3 \\(\\ \\) Eigenvectors can be calculated using the R function eigen() applied to the abcd matrix that defines the linear differential equation. For the system of first-order differential equations \\[\\partial_t x = x + y\\\\\\partial_t y = 2x\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\] the matrix is, as we’ve seen, \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\] Carrying out the eigenvector calculation is straightforward: M &lt;- cbind(rbind(1,2), rbind(1,0)) eigen(M) ## eigen() decomposition ## $values ## [1] 2 -1 ## ## $vectors ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.7071068 -0.4472136 ## [2,] 0.7071068 0.8944272 The eigenvectors are the two columns of the matrix labeled vectors returned by the calculation. Here, that’s \\[\\vec{\\Lambda_1} = \\left[\\begin{array}{r}0.7071\\\\0.7071\\end{array}\\right] \\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\vec{\\Lambda_2} = \\left[\\begin{array}{r}-0.4472\\\\0.8944\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\] The calculation also produces eigenvalues. Here that’s \\(\\lambda_1 = 2\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -1\\). We can see what’s special about \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_1}\\) and \\(\\vec{\\Lambda_2}\\) by plotting them along with the flow field, as in Figure 53.3. Figure 53.3: The eigenvectors for the \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0\\end{array}\\right]\\) plotted along with the flow. The eigenvectors mark the directions where the flow is either directly toward the fixed point or directly away from it. Here, the flow on the subspace of \\(\\color{magenta}{\\vec{\\Lambda_1}}\\) is away from the fixed point, while the flow along the subspace of \\(\\color{blue}{\\vec{\\Lambda_2}}\\) is inward to the fixed point. The consequence of this alignment of the flow with the eigenvectors is that the trajectory from any initial condition \\(m_1 \\vec{\\Lambda_1}\\) will have the form \\(m_1(t) \\vec{\\Lambda_1}\\) and similarly for an initial condition \\(m_2(t) \\vec{\\Lambda_2}\\). As we did in the previous section, let’s calculate the trajectories \\(\\color{magenta}{\\vec{\\Lambda_1(t)}}\\) and \\(\\color{blue}{\\vec{\\Lambda_2(t)}}\\) starting at the two eigenvectors and plot out the \\(y(t)\\) component of the solution. Since we’re anticipating an exponential form for the function, we’ll use semi-log axes, where an exponential will look like a straight line. traj_eigen1 &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x + y, dy ~ 2*x, x=0.7071, y=0.7071) traj_eigen2 &lt;- integrateODE(dx ~ x + y, dy ~ 2*x, x=-0.4472, y=0.8944) traj_plot(y(t) ~ t, traj_eigen1, color=&quot;magenta&quot;) %&gt;% traj_plot(y(t) ~ t, traj_eigen2, color=&quot;blue&quot;) %&gt;% gf_refine(scale_y_log10(breaks=c(0.3290, 0.7071, 0.8944, 5.2248))) We’ve marked the \\(y\\) axis with the starting and ending values of each function, so that you can find the exponential parameter \\(k\\) for each function. \\[\\color{magenta}{y_1(t) = 0.7071 e^{k_1 t}}\\\\ \\color{blue}{y_2(t)} = 0.8944 e^{k_2 t}\\] To find \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\), plug in \\(t=1\\) to the solution: \\[\\color{magenta}{y_1(1) = 5.2248 = 0.7071 e^{k_1}} \\implies k_1=2\\\\ \\color{blue}{y_2(1) = 0.3290 = 0.8944 e^{k_2}} \\implies k_2 = -1\\] Look back at the results from the eigen(M) calculation. These values for \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) are exactly the eigenvalues that were computed from the matrix M. In standard notation, rather than \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\), the notation \\(\\lambda_1 = k_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = k_2\\) is preferred. (Remember, \\(\\lambda\\) is the Greek letter “lambda” in it’s lower-case form.) Every solution to the differential equation has the form \\[m_1\\, e^{\\lambda_1 t} \\vec{\\Lambda_1} + m_2\\, e^{\\lambda_2 t} \\vec{\\Lambda_2}\\ .\\] The scalar coefficients \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) can be found from the initial condition. The stability of the system depends only on \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\). If either one of these is positive, then the system is unstable. 53.3 Exercises Exercise XX.XX: OwCtGH The exercise is based on the interactive applet shown below.

For instance, \\[\\partial_t x = f(x, y)\\\\ \\partial_t y = g(x, y)\\] where \\(f(x,y)\\) and \\(g(x,y)\\) are the dynamical functions. This is not the style in which differential equations were introduced in the late 1600s. Instead, Isaac Newton (1642-1727) wrote his differential equations in the format of his Second Law of Motion, which reads (in a 1792 translation): LAW II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. — Source In contemporary language, we would say things differently. Instead of “alteration of motion” we would write \\(\\partial_t v\\), where \\(v\\) is the velocity of the moving object. We call \\(\\partial_t v\\) the acceleration. Instead of “motive force” we would say simply “force,” and instead of “made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed”, we would say that velocity, acceleration, and force are vector quantities. Newton’s “ever proportional to” amounts to saying that \\[\\partial_t \\vec{v} = b \\vec{F}\\,\\] that is, change in motion is proportional to force. Newton stipulated that the constant of proportionality, \\(b\\), is the reciprocal of mass, that is \\(1/m\\). Writing acceleration \\(\\vec{a} = \\partial_t \\vec{v}\\), the previous equation amounts to \\[m \\vec{a} = \\vec{F}\\ ,\\] the form in which beginning physics students first hear it. Newton, of course, was very interested in gravity. From previous experiments dropping weights and rolling balls down ramps, as was done by Galileo Galilee (1564-1642), Newton knew that the force of gravity on an object (near the surface of Earth) is proportional to the object’s mass, that is \\[\\vec{F} = -g m\\ ,\\] where the direction of \\(\\vec{F}\\) is straight downwards toward the center of the Earth. The negative sign in front of \\(g\\) reflects this downward direction. We’re assuming that position and velocity are both defined in a positive, upward direction.1 developed his Theory of General Relativity.] The simple model of an object moving under the force of gravity is \\(\\partial_t v = g\\). Notice that this is not a linear differential equation—\\(g\\) is not a linear function of \\(v\\) but a constant, and there’s no fixed point—so the solution is not an exponential. But we can find the solution easily enough by integrating both sides of the equation with respect to \\(t\\). \\[\\int \\partial_t v\\, dt = \\int -g\\, dt \\ \\ \\implies v(t) = -g\\, t + C\\] where \\(C\\) captures the constants of integration from both integrals into one number. It’s worth noticing how much mathematics needs to be understood before this method of solution makes sense. The fundamental theorem of calculus is what tells us that \\(\\int \\partial_t v\\, dt = v(t) + B\\), and you have to know about how to anti-differentiate a constant function to make sense of \\(\\int g\\, dt = -g\\,t + D\\). You also need to know why constants of integration, such as \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), get included when writing the function that results from an anti-differentiation. (You might need to revisit Block 3 to refresh your memory about such things.) There’s also some physical context to be considered. By setting \\(t=0\\) in \\(v(t) = -g\\,t + C\\), for instance, we can identify \\(C\\) as the velocity at time zero, which we might write \\(v(0)\\) or \\(v_0\\) for short. And what about the position of the object? The solution \\(v(t) = -g\\,t + v_0\\) has nothing to say directly about the position \\(x(t)\\) of the object as a function of time. We can work position \\(x(t)\\) into things by recognizing that \\(v(t) = \\partial_t x(t)\\), which is the definition of velocity. Anti-differentiating both sides of \\(v(t) = -g\\, t + v_0\\) gives us a more complete story that include both initial velocity \\(v_0\\) and initial position \\(x_0\\): \\[\\int v(t)\\, dt = \\int \\left(\\strut -g\\, t + v_0\\right)\\ dt \\implies x(t) = -\\frac{1}{2} g\\,t^2 + v_0\\,t + x_0\\ , \\] where \\(x_0\\) is the constant of integration from this second stage of anti-differentiation. (Plug in \\(t=0\\) to see why we’re justified in taking \\(x_0\\) as the initial position.)2 Still one more way to write the dynamics of falling under the influence of gravity …. Recognizing that \\(v(t) = \\partial_t x(t)\\), we can see that \\(\\partial_t v(t) = \\partial_{tt} x(t)\\). So the original differential equation could be written: \\[\\partial_{tt} x = -g\\] This is an example of a second-order differential equation, so called because of the appearance of a second derivative, \\(\\partial_{tt}x\\). In this chapter, we’ll study second-order differential equations in a variety of contexts. But, as for Newton, movement under the influence of gravity will be a focus. Since the second-order differentiation can be interpreted as representing the balance between force and acceleration, we’ll call these force-balance equations. In general, a force-balance equation has the form \\[\\partial_{tt} x = f(\\partial_t x, x)\\], the acceleration is a function both of position and velocity. In the above example, the dynamical function has a particularly simple form: \\(f(\\partial_t x, x) \\equiv -g\\). Second-order differential equations can always be written as a pair of first-order differential equations. To see this, let one of the first-order equations be \\[\\partial_t x = v\\ .\\] The other equation, \\(\\partial_{tt} x = f(\\partial_t x, x)\\) can be re-written in terms of \\(v\\): \\[\\partial_t v = f(v, x)\\ .\\] Since we know how to solve sets of first-order differential equations by Euler’s method, we can always find the solution \\(x(t)\\) to any second-order differential equation. 54.1 Ballistics A lot of the theory of second-order differential equations was developed in the setting of a ball being set off with an initial velocity from an initial position. Such a focus on the flight of balls might seem trivial. Fortunately, language allows us to construct a scientific-sounding word by adding the suffix “istic” to the root “ball.” This suffixing produces the word ballistics. The importance of ballistics to Newton can be seen by a famous diagram he drew, shown in Figure 54.1. In the diagram, Newton traces the path of a ball shot horizontally from a cannon placed at the top of a mountain. Figure 54.1: Newton’s diagram showing ballistic motion under the force of gravity. Since the motion in Newton’s diagram has both vertical and horizontal components, we’re going to need two second-order differential equations: \\[\\text{Horizontal}: \\ \\ \\partial_{tt} x = 0\\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{Vertical}: \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\partial_{tt} y = -g\\] The zero on the right-hand side of the equation of horizontal movement reflects that gravity does not act horizontally. We found a solution for the vertical equation in the previous section, \\[y(t) = -\\frac{1}{2} g\\,t^2 + 0\\,t + y_0\\ .\\] The \\(0\\, t\\) component to the solution reflects that the vertical component of the ball, coming out of the cannon, is zero. The solution for the horizontal component of motion can be found by anti-differentiating both sides of the equation of hortizontal motion: \\[\\int \\partial_{tt} x(t)\\, dt = \\partial_t x(t) = \\int 0\\, dt = v_0\\] where \\(v_0\\) is the initial horizontal velocity. A second stage of anti-differentiation gives \\(x(t)\\) itself: \\[\\int \\partial_t x(t) = \\int v_0 dt = v_0\\, t + x_0\\] Regrettably, symbolic anti-differentiation works only in simple cases. To support more realistic models of ballistics, let’s see how to translate the two second-order differential equations into sets of first-order equations. The state variables will be \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\), but we also have to add another pair, \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) standing for the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively. The first-order equations will be: \\[\\partial_t x = u\\\\ \\partial_t y = v\\\\ \\partial_t u = 0\\\\ \\partial_t v = -g \\] To illustrate, we’ll solve this set of four first-order equations numerically. We need to specify the initial values for \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\), \\(u_0\\) and \\(v_0\\). We’ll let the cannon be located at horizontal position \\(x_0 = 0\\) and vertical position \\(y_0 = 100\\) meters. The vertical velocity is, initially, zero, so \\(v_0 = 0\\). And suppose the cannon produces an initial horizontal velocity of \\(u_0 = 250\\) meters/sec. The constant \\(g\\) is known to be 9.8 meters/sec2. Here’s the trajectory: traj &lt;- integrateODE( dx ~ u, dy ~ v, du ~ 0, dv ~ -9.8, #dynamics x=0, y=100, u = 250, v=0, #initial conditions tdur=5 ) traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj) traj_plot(v(t) ~ u(t), traj) P1 &lt;- traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj) %&gt;% gf_hline(yintercept=~0, color=&quot;brown&quot;) %&gt;% gf_labs(subtitle=&quot;(x, y) position as a function of time&quot;) P2 &lt;- traj_plot(v(t) ~ u(t), traj) %&gt;% gf_labs(subtitle=&quot;(u, v) velocity as a function of time&quot;) gridExtra::grid.arrange(P1, P2, nrow=1) Figure 54.2: Trajectory of the cannon ball shot with an initial horizontal velocity and no initial vertical velocity. The trajectory is plotted in slices of state space: position \\((x, y)\\) and velocity \\((u, v)\\). The time at which the ball reaches the points marked on the trajectory give the time. The left panel in Figure 54.2 shows that the trajectory is a parabola. At about \\(t=4.4\\) secs the \\(y\\) position is zero. If zero is the location of the ground, the part of the trajectory for \\(4.4 &lt; t\\) is invalid, since the ball has already hit the ground. The ball travels a little more than 1100 meters horizontally before hitting the ground. The right panel might seem somewhat strange. You can see that the vertical component of velocity, \\(v(t)\\) starts out at zero and increases linearly with time, becoming more and more negative as gravity continuous to accelerate the ball downward. The vertical velocity, \\(u(t)\\), stays constant at \\(u(t) = 250\\) meters per second. This is because there is no horizontal force on the ball. The world’s first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer was started up in 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania, where it is still on display. The date and location have something to say about why the computer was built. 1945 is, of course, at the end of World War II. The computer was built to carry out some important war-time calculations. The place, Philadelpha, Pennsylvania, has to do with the location of the US Army’s center for developing and testing ordnance: the Aberdeen Proving Ground which is only 75 miles from the University of Pennsylvania. The name given to the computer, ENIAC, has a science-fiction flavor but is in fact rooted in its purpose: the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. ENIAC was constructed to calculate the trajectories of artillery shells. Knowing the trajectory is essential to being able to fire artillery accurately. The ballistics of real world artillery shells is more complex than the simple model we constructed earlier. What’s missing from that model is air resistance, which is a function of the shell’s velocity and altitude. To illustrate, let’s add in a simple model of air resistance to the earlier ballistic model. In this model, the force of air resistence is a vector pointing in the opposite direction to overall velocity and proportional to velocity squared. The velocity vector is simply \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}u\\\\v\\end{array}\\right]\\). The air resistence force will be \\[-\\alpha\\sqrt{\\strut u^2 + v^2} \\left[\\begin{array}{c}u\\\\v\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\] Consequently, the horizontal component of the air-resistence vector is \\(-\\alpha\\, u \\sqrt{\\strut u^2 + v^2}\\) and the vertical component is \\(-\\alpha\\, v \\sqrt{\\strut u^2 + v^2}\\). Incorporating air resistence into the model can be done like this: \\[r(u, v) \\equiv \\alpha \\sqrt{\\strut u^2 + v^2}\\\\ \\partial_t x = u\\\\ \\partial_t y = v\\\\ \\partial_t u = -u\\, r(u,v)\\\\ \\partial_t v = -g - v\\, r(u,v)\\] ENIAC would have been programmed to carry out the calculation we now do with integrateODE(): r &lt;- makeFun(alpha*sqrt(u^2 + v^2) ~ u &amp; v, alpha=0.003) traj2 &lt;- integrateODE( dx ~ u, dy ~ v, du ~ -u*r(u,v), dv ~ -9.8 - v*r(u,v), #dynamics x=0, y=100, u = 250, v=0, #initial conditions tdur=6 ) traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj) traj_plot(v(t) ~ u(t), traj) P1 &lt;- gf_hline(yintercept=~0, color=&quot;brown&quot;) %&gt;% traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj, nt=2, color=&quot;orange&quot;) %&gt;% traj_plot(y(t) ~ x(t), traj2) %&gt;% gf_labs(subtitle=&quot;(x, y) position as a function of time&quot;) P2 &lt;- traj_plot(v(t) ~ u(t), traj2) %&gt;% gf_labs(subtitle=&quot;(u, v) velocity as a function of time&quot;) gridExtra::grid.arrange(P1, P2, nrow=1) Figure 54.3: Adding air resistence to the model changes the trajectory.

Air resistance causes the cannon ball to travel a shorter horizontal distance and to arrive with a much reduced velocity. 54.2 The harmonic oscillator Consider the motion of a weight attached to a spring, as in Figure ??. We’ll denote the vertical position of the mass by \\(y(t)\\). Such a spring-mass system has a fixed point where the spring is stretched just enough to cancel out gravity and the velocity is zero. We’ll measure \\(y\\) relative to this fixed point. Figure 54.4: A spring-mass system in motion. Source: Svjo CC BY-SA via Wikimedia Commons According to Hooke’s Law, a stretched or compressed spring exerts a force that is proportional to the amount of extension or compression. With our measuring \\(y\\) relative to the fixed point, the Hooke’s Law force will be \\[m\\, \\partial_{tt} y = - s\\, y\\ ,\\] where \\(m\\) is the amount of mass and \\(s\\) is the stiffness of the spring. This force-balance equation corresponds to the second-order differential equation \\[\\partial_{tt} y = - \\frac{s}{m} y\\ .\\] You can see that the motion is oscillatory, which suggests that the solution to the differential equation will be of the form \\(y(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t)\\). Taking this as an ansatz leads to finding a value of \\(\\omega\\), which is called the angular frequency of the oscillation. (In terms of the period of oscillation \\(P\\), the angular frequency is \\(\\omega = 2 \\pi/P\\).) To find \\(\\omega\\), plug in the ansatz to the differential equation: \\[\\partial_{tt} A \\sin(\\omega t) = - \\frac{s}{m}\\, A \\sin(\\omega t)\\] Differentiating \\(\\sin(\\omega t)\\) once let’s us re-write the left-hand side of the equation in terms of a first derivative \\[\\partial_{t} A \\omega\\, \\cos(\\omega t) = - \\frac{s}{m}\\, A \\sin(\\omega t)\\] Differentiating again gives \\[- \\omega^2 A\\sin(\\omega\\, t) = - \\frac{s}{m}\\, A\\sin(\\omega t)\\ .\\] Simplifying this by cancelling out the \\(A \\sin(\\omega t)\\) term gives \\(\\omega^2 = \\frac{s}{m}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the oscillation. Instead of using \\(A \\sin(\\omega t)\\) as the ansatz we could have used \\(A \\sin(\\omega t) + B \\cos(\\omega t)\\). Working through this ansatz would produce exactly the same result, that \\(\\omega^2 = \\frac{s}{m}\\). So the solution to the spring-mass system will be, in general, a linear combination of the sine and the cosine functions with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\). 54.3 Exponential or sinusoid? In Chapter 53, we established that solutions to second-order linear differential equations have the form \\(m_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + m_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}\\). Yet in the previous section, we saw one linear second-order differential equation, \\(\\partial_{tt} y = - \\omega^2 y\\) where the solution is a linear combination of a sine and a cosine function: \\(y(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) + B \\cos(\\omega t)\\) with \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{m}}\\). How is it possible for the solution to be both in the form of a linear combination of exponentials and a linear combination of sine and cosine? Sinusoids oscillate up and down and up and down, whereas exponentials are monotonic. To find out what might be the relationship between an exponential and a sinusoid, let’s plug an exponential ansatz \\(y(t) = A e^{\\lambda t}\\) into the spring-mass system \\(\\partial_{tt} y = -\\omega^2 y\\). \\[\\partial_{tt} A e^{\\lambda t} = \\lambda^2 A e^{\\lambda t} = -\\omega^2 A e^{\\lambda t}\\ .\\] As before, we’ll cancel out the common term \\(A e^{\\lambda t}\\) to get a simple relationship: \\[\\lambda^2 = -\\omega^2\\ \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ \\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut-1}\\ \\omega \\ .\\] Generally, the symbol \\(i\\) is used to stand for \\(\\sqrt{\\strut -1}\\), so our eigenvalues can be written \\(\\lambda = \\pm i \\omega\\). The solution to the spring-mass system, according to this analysis, is: \\[y(t) = m_1 e^{i\\omega t} + m_2 e^{-i \\omega t}\\] In other words, \\(e^{i \\omega t}\\)—notice the \\(i\\) in the argument to the exponential—is a sinusoid with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\). 54.4 Exponentials with “imaginary” inputs The “imaginary” in the section title is used in it’s mathematical sense. In interpreting the word “imaginary,” you should keep in mind a long history in mathematics of assigning insulting names to mathematical objects that, at the time they were first introduced. That’s why some numbers are vilified as “negative,” and some as “irrational.” The insult is even more dire for numbers like \\(i\\), which are called the “imaginary” numbers. Regrettably, the word “imaginary” leads many people to shy away from them, just as many people avoid genres such as fantasy fiction. That imaginary numbers are introduced as kind of freakish—is there actually a numerical value for \\(\\sqrt{\\strut -1}\\)?—and rarely touched until advanced calculus, means that students are unused to them. You’ll only get comfortable with “imaginary” numbers when you start to work with them extensively, as happens in physics and engineering courses. Our goal here is merely to increase your awareness of imaginary numbers and some of the ways they are used in the sciences. To that end, we offer three different approaches to understanding the function \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\). Basic, pragmatic understanding. This is the level of understanding that you must have in order to make sense of the rest of this chapter and Chapter 55. Here it is: \\[e^{i\\omega t}\\ \\text{is simply a shorthand for}\\ \\cos(\\omega t).\\] So whenever you see \\(e^{i \\omega t}\\), think of \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\). Algebraic understanding via Taylor Polynomials. (optional) This level of understanding can give you confidence that the basic, pragmatic understanding in (1) has honest roots. It also shows the way that (1) is not 100% on target (although good enough for a large fraction of mathematical work). But for many people, algebra is a rocky road to understanding. The starting point for the algebraic understanding is the Taylor polynomial approximation for \\(e^{\\omega t}\\). Recall from Chapter 26 that \\[e^{\\omega t} = 1 + \\omega t + \\frac{1}{2!}\\omega^2 t^2 + \\frac{1}{3!}\\omega^3 t^3 + \\frac{1}{4!} \\omega^4 t^4 + \\frac{1}{5!} \\omega^5 t^5 + \\frac{1}{6!} \\omega^6 t^6 + \\cdots\\] You may also recall the Taylor polynomial expansion of sine and cosine: \\[ \\cos(\\omega t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2!} \\omega^2 t^2 + \\frac{1}{4!}\\omega^4 t^4 - \\frac{1}{6!} \\omega^6 t^6 + \\cdots\\] \\[\\color{magenta}{\\sin(\\omega t) = \\omega t - \\frac{1}{3!}\\omega^3 t^3 + \\frac{1}{5!} \\omega^5 t^5 + \\cdots}\\] You can see some association between \\(e^{wt}\\), \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\), and \\(\\sin{\\omega t}\\) by looking at \\[\\cos(\\omega t) + \\color{magenta}{i \\sin(\\omega t)} = 1 + \\color{magenta}{i \\omega t} -\\frac{1}{2!} \\omega^2 t^2 - \\color{magenta}{i \\frac{1}{3!} \\omega^3 t^3} + \\frac{1}{4!}\\omega^4 t^4 + \\color{magenta}{i \\frac{1}{5!} \\omega^5 t^5} - \\frac{1}{6!}\\omega^6 t^6 + \\cdots\\] Now consider the Taylor polynomial for \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\). This will be the same as the Taylor polynomial for \\(e^{\\omega t}\\) but everywhere substituting \\(i \\omega\\) in place of the plain \\(\\omega\\). That is: \\[e^{i \\omega t} = 1 + \\color{magenta}{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{2!}i^2\\omega^2 t^2 + \\color{magenta}{\\frac{1}{3!}i^3\\omega^3 t^3} + \\frac{1}{4!} i^4\\omega^4 t^4 + \\color{magenta}{\\frac{1}{5!} i^5\\omega^5 t^5} + \\frac{1}{6!} i^6\\omega^6 t^6 + \\cdots\\] Since \\(i\\equiv \\sqrt{\\strut -1}\\), we have the following facts for the powers \\(i^n\\): \\[i^2 = -1\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\color{magenta}{i^3 = -i}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i^4 = 1\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\color{magenta}{i^5 = i}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i^6 = -1\\ \\ \\text{and so on}.\\] Substitute these facts about \\(i^n\\) into the Taylor polynomial for \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\): \\[e^{i \\omega t} = 1 + \\color{magenta}{i\\omega t} - \\frac{1}{2!}\\omega^2 t^2 - \\color{magenta}{i \\frac{1}{3!}\\omega^3 t^3} + \\frac{1}{4!} \\omega^4 t^4 + \\color{magenta}{i \\frac{1}{5!} \\omega^5 t^5} - \\frac{1}{6!} \\omega^6 t^6 + \\cdots\\] which exactly matches the Taylor polynomial for \\(\\cos{\\omega t} + \\color{magenta}{i \\sin(\\omega t)}\\). The arithmetic of complex numbers. (optional) A complex number is a number like \\(2 - 3i\\) which consists of two parts: the real-part \\(2\\) and the imaginary part \\(-3\\). When you multiply one complex number by another you get a complex number (although either the real or imaginary parts might happen to be zero.) For example: \\[(2 + 3i)^2 = (2+3i)(2+3i) = \\underbrace{4}_{2\\times 2} + \\underbrace{ \\ 6 i\\ }_{2 (3i)} + \\underbrace{\\ 6 i\\ }_{(3i)2}\\ \\ \\underbrace{- 9}_{(3i)(3i)}\\ = -5 +12 i.\\] R knows the rules for arithmetic on complex numbers. Here’s a demonstration of the oscillations that result from raising a complex number to successive powers. lambda &lt;- 0.65 + 0.76i lambda^2 ## [1] -0.1551+0.988i lambda^3 ## [1] -0.851695+0.524324i lambda^4 ## [1] -0.952088-0.3064776i lambda^5 ## [1] -0.3859342-0.9227973i lambda^6 ## [1] 0.4504687-0.8931283i lambda^7 ## [1] 0.9715821-0.2381771i lambda^8 ## [1] 0.812543+0.5835873i lambda^9 ## [1] 0.0846266+0.9968644i lambda^10 ## [1] -0.7026097+0.7122781i Notice that the real part of the result oscillates between negative and positive. The imaginary part also oscillates, but delayed a bit from the real part. Just like sine and cosine. We can get a clearer picture by plotting \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) over the domain \\(0 &lt; t &lt; 10\\). As an example, in Figure 54.5 we’ll set \\(\\omega = 2\\). We need to be a little careful, since our plotting functions are not arranged to display complex numbers. But there is an easy workaround: plot the “real” and “imaginary” parts separately. The R operators Re() and Im() do this work. f &lt;- makeFun(exp(1i * omega * t) ~ t, omega = 2) slice_plot(Re(f(t)) ~ t, domain(t=c(0, 10)), color = &quot;magenta&quot;) %&gt;% slice_plot(Im(f(t)) ~ t, color=&quot;brown&quot;) Figure 54.5: The real and imaginary parts of \\(e^{i \\omega t}\\) plotted as a function of \\(t\\). 54.5 Damping It’s common for there to be friction, called damping, in a spring mass system. To keep things very simple, we’ll consider that the friction is proportional to the velocity and, as in the cannonball example, in the direction opposite to velocity. That is: \\[\\partial_{tt} y = -r\\, \\partial_t y -b y\\ ,\\] where \\(b\\) would be the positive number \\(\\frac{s}{m}\\) and \\(r\\) is another positive number reflecting the magnitude of friction. (Think of \\(r\\) as standing for “resistance.”) As always, this second-order differential equation can be written as a pair of first-order differential equations. One of the first-order differential equations will be \\[\\partial_t y = v\\ ,\\], which is just the definition of velocity \\(v\\). The other first-order equation will be \\[\\partial_t v = -r v - b y\\ .\\] Both equations are linear. In the previous chapter, we wrote such a pair of linear first-order differential equations in terms of a vector \\[\\vec{w(t)} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}v(t)\\\\y(t)\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\] In terms of the vector \\(\\vec{w(t)}\\) the dynamics can be written in vector/matrix form: \\[\\partial_t \\vec{w} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}-r \\ \\ \\ -b\\ \\ \\\\1 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\, \\vec{w}\\ .\\] This form suggests, at least to the avid reader of the previous chapter, that we look for a solution \\(y(t) = m_1\\, e^{\\lambda_1\\, t} + m_2\\, e^{\\lambda_2\\, t}\\) in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}r &amp; b\\\\1 &amp; 0\\end{array}\\right]\\). We used the R function eigen() to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, given numerical values for \\(r\\) and \\(b\\). Let’s now try to find an algebraic formula for the eigenvalues. After all, it’s the eigenvalues that determine the stability of the fixed point. As an ansatz for the for the original second-order differential equation \\[\\partial_{tt} y = r\\, \\partial_t y + b y\\ ,\\] let’s use \\(y(t) = A e^{\\lambda t}\\), a simple exponential function. Plugging in the ansatz to the differential equation gives: \\[A \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t} = - r A \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} - b A e^{\\lambda t}\\ .\\] We can cancel out the common term \\(A e^{\\lambda t}\\) from all the terms in the equation, and bring all the terms to the left-hand side of the equation, leaving us with \\[\\lambda^2 + r \\lambda + b = 0\\ .\\] This is a quadratic polynomial in \\(\\lambda\\), so we can use the “quadratic formula” to find values for \\(\\lambda\\) that are consistent with the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In applying the quadratic formula you have to remember that the standard statement is for the roots of \\(a x^2 + b x + c = 0\\) and make adjustment for the fact that our polynomial uses the parameter names differently: \\(\\lambda^2 + r \\lambda + b = 0\\). \\[\\lambda = \\frac{- r \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut r^2 - 4 b}}{2}\\ .\\] Recall that the parameter \\(r\\) describes the amount of friction or resistence in the system; it’s a positive number. Similarly, the nature of springs is that \\(b\\) is a positive number. The relative values of \\(r\\) and \\(b\\) determine the motion of the system. Suppose the stiffness of the spring is much larger than the friction. Then \\(r^2 &lt; 4b\\). This being the case, the \\(\\sqrt{\\strut r^2 - 4 b}/2\\) will be an imaginary number. Altogether, the eigenvalues will be \\(\\lambda = -\\frac{r}{2} \\pm {i \\omega}\\). The solution will be \\[y = m_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + m_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t} \\\\ = m_1 e^{-\\frac{r}{2}t + i \\omega t} + m_2 e^{\\frac{r}{2} - i\\omega t} \\\\ = m_1 e^{-r t/2} e^{i\\omega t} + m_2 e^{-r t/2} e^{-i \\omega t} \\\\ = e^{-r t/2}\\underbrace{\\left[m_1 e^{i \\omega t} + m2 e^{i\\omega t}\\right]}_{\\text{sinusoid}(\\omega t)}\\] Result: an exponentially decaying sinusoid. To graph this function, we need to choose appropriate numerical values for \\(r\\) and \\(b\\). Let’s set \\(r=1\\). Since \\(r^2 &lt; 4b\\), we must have \\(\\frac{1}{4} &lt; b\\): we’ll choose \\(b = 6\\) which meets this criterion. Figure 54.6 shows the solution to the differential equation: traj &lt;- integrateODE(dv~ -r*v - b*y, dy ~ v, v=10, y=0, r=1, b=6, tdur=20) traj_plot(y(t) ~ t, traj) Figure 54.6: An exponentially decaying sinusoid arising from \\(r = 1\\) and \\(b = 6\\). This is the situation with a swinging door. You shove it to swing open, after which it oscillates with a decreasing amplitude. In contrast, suppose the spring is weak compared to the damping such that \\(4b &lt; r^2\\). Now \\(\\sqrt{\\strut r^2 - 4b}\\) is a positive number, not imaginary. What’s more, since \\(b\\) is positive, \\(\\sqrt{\\strut r^2 - 4 b} &lt; r\\). This means that both eigenvalues are negative. We’ll illustrate the situation with \\(r=1, b=0.2\\): traj2 &lt;- integrateODE(dv~ -r*v - b*y, dy ~ v, v=10, y=0, r=1, b=0.1, tdur=20) traj_plot(y(t) ~ t, traj2) %&gt;% gf_lims(y = c(0, NA)) Figure 54.7: A heavily damped spring-mass system with \\(r = 1\\) and \\(b = 0.1\\). The situation in Figure 54.7 is the sort of behavior one expects when giving a shove to an exit door in theater or stadium. The shove causes the door to swing open, after which it slowly returns to the closed position. That gives plenty of time for the people following you to get to the door before it closes. Finally, consider the case where \\(r^2 - 4 b = 0\\), a balance between resistance and springiness. In this case, both eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda = -r/2\\). traj3 &lt;- integrateODE(dv~ -r*v - b*y, dy ~ v, v=10, y=0, r=1, b=0.25, tdur=20) traj_plot(y(t) ~ t, traj3) %&gt;% gf_lims(y = c(0, NA)) Figure 54.8: A critically damped oscillation with \\(r=1\\), \\(b=0.25\\). This is a situation called critically damped. The door swings open, then closes as fast as it can without any oscillation. Example 54.1 \\(\\ \\) Consider the second-order linear differential equation \\[\\partial_{tt} y + 2\\, \\partial_t y - 3\\, y = 0\\ .\\] Is this system stable? For this system, \\(a=2\\) and \\(b = - 3\\), so the eigenvalues are \\[\\lambda = \\left(-2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut 4 + 12}\\right)/2 = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut 16}/2 = -1 \\pm 2\\] In other words, \\(\\lambda_1 = -3\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = +1\\). This indicates that the system is a saddle: unstable in one direction and stable in the other. To confirm our work, let’s use eigen() to find the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2 &amp; 3\\\\1 &amp; 0\\end{array}\\right]\\): M &lt;- cbind(rbind(-2,1), rbind(3,0)) eigen(M) ## eigen() decomposition ## $values ## [1] -3 1 ## ## $vectors ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -0.9486833 -0.7071068 ## [2,] 0.3162278 -0.7071068 Although R is doing all the calculations for us, it’s possible to write the directions of the eigenvectors only in terms of the eigenvectors: \\[\\vec{\\Lambda_1} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_1\\\\1\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\vec{\\Lambda_2} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_2\\\\1\\end{array}\\right]\\] For the system with \\(\\lambda_1 = 3\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -1\\), you can confirm that the eigenvectors calculated with this formula point in the same directions as the eigenvectors reported by eigen(). Let’s return to the car-following control system introduced in Chapter 53. Recall that \\(x\\) was defined to be the distance between two cars and \\(x_0\\) the distance to be maintained. In terms of \\(y = x - x_0\\) the system was \\[\\partial_{tt} y = - b y\\ .\\] You can see that this system has no damping; \\(y(t)\\) will be a sinusoidal oscillation. The ride will be more pleasant, however, if the oscillations can be damped out. To accomplish this, we should add a new term to the second-order differential equation, a damping term to give \\[\\partial_{tt} y = -a\\, \\partial_t y- b\\, y\\ .\\] We should set the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to make the real part of the eigenvalues negative. Only then will we have designed a workable control system. For a human driver, following a car at a steady distance requires careful attention but in practice is not too difficult a task. Could it be the case that drivers have an intuitive understanding of the need for damping? Perhaps complex eigenvalues ought to be a standard topic in driving schools? That might be, but there is a more down-to-earth explanation of how humans handle the car-following task. The quantity \\(\\partial_{tt} y\\) is the acceleration, and the control pedal that leads to positive acceleration is called the “accelerator.” But the pedal does not actually set acceleration. In reality, the pedal sets velocity as well as acceleration. A simple model is \\(\\text{pedal} = r \\partial_t y + s \\partial_{tt} y\\), where \\(y\\) is the velocity of the car and \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are positive parameters. To understand this model of the pedal, think what happens when you press the accelerator and hold it. The car accelerates, but only up to the point where a steady state velocity is reached. Or, consider what happens if you partially release the pedal. The car slows down until it reaches a new, slower, steady-state velocity. With a human driver, the control system is not \\(\\partial_{tt} y = - b y\\). Instead, the control system is \\[\\text{pedal} - p_0 = - b y\\ .\\] For steady-state driving at the desired velocity \\(\\partial_t y\\) we press the pedal by an amount \\(p_0\\). To perform the car-following task, we push down or lighten up on the pedal, depending on whether we are farther or closer to the car ahead than our desired distance. Combining the models for how \\(\\text{pedal}\\) is controlled and how \\(\\text{pedal}\\) relates to velocity and acceleration, we have \\[r \\partial_t y + s \\partial_{tt} y - p_0 = -b y\\] or, re-arranging terms \\[ \\partial_{tt} y = \\underbrace{- \\frac{r}{s} \\partial_t y}_{\\text{damping}} - \\frac{b}{s} y + p_0\\ .\\] The nature of the gas pedal itself leads to a damping term in the dynamics, without our having to think about it consciously. 54.6 Exercises Exercise 53.03: IVEjiX Passive electrical circuits Second-order differential equations are used to model simple electrical circuits. In a step outside of calculus (meaning: you won’t be examined on it) it’s worth pointing out the correspondence between concepts of motion (acceleration, velocity, position) and electrical circuits (voltage, current, charge). There are three classical idealized passive components of circuits: capacitor, denoted resistor, denoted inductor, denoted In every case, we will be interested in the voltage across the two ends of the component. And we’ll think about the dynamics of the circuit in terms of electrical charge which we’ll denote \\(x\\). For a capacitor the voltage is proportional to charge \\(x/C\\), where \\(C\\) is the “size” of the capacitor. For a resistor the voltage is proportional to the flow of charge, that is, current \\(r \\dot{x}\\), where \\(R\\) is the amount of resistance, basically the “size” of the resistor. For an inductor the voltage is proportional to the change in the flow of charge, that is, \\(L \\ddot{x}\\), where \\(L\\) is the inductance. Only a capacitor is capable of holding a voltage on its own. The other circuit elements can carry a voltage when they are part of a circuit. We’re going to explore a simple circuit. To prime the circuit, we’re going to connect the two dots at the bottom of the circuit with a battery. This will charge up the capacitor in much the same way as we “charge up” a spring by pulling on it. Next remove the battery and get ready to observe the motion. Complete the circuit by closing the switch between the two dots. Doing so establishes the circuit, analogous to setting up the dynamics of the system. The initial condition is the amount of charge \\(x\\) on the capacitor and, at the instant the switch is closed, no flow of current, giving \\(\\dot{x} = 0\\). The “force-balance” is the requirement that the sum of the voltages across the circuit elements be zero. This amounts to \\[L \\ddot{x} = -R\\, \\dot{x} - \\frac{1}{C} x \\] Consider a circuit with inductance \\(L=1\\), resistance \\(R=3\\) and capacitance \\(C = 1\\). What will be the eigenvalues of the dynamics? Will the fixed point at \\(x=0\\) be stable or not? Exercise 53.05: P4xpYP Friction is an inevitable feature of real-world spring-mass systems. Without friction the spring-mass force-balance differential equation is \\(m\\partial_{tt} x = -k\\, x\\). How does friction fit in? For a mass moving at velocity \\(\\dot{x}\\), the friction force will be in the direction opposed to the velocity and, when velocity is zero, friction goes away. Following our general calculus idea of approximating with a simple straight-line function, we get a force \\(\\text{friction} = -r \\dot{x}\\). Adding in the friction force gives a new force-balance equation which has a famous name in physics: the “damped harmonic oscillator.” \\[m \\ddot{x} = -r \\dot{x} - k x\\] Note that all of the coefficients \\(m, r\\), and \\(k\\) are positive Since we’ve gotten in the habit of using \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on the right side of the equation, we’ll re-write the force-balance equation as \\[\\ddot{x} = a \\dot{x} + b x\\] where \\(a = -r/m\\) and \\(b = -k/m\\). As the name “damped harmonic oscillator” suggests, we expect that the solution to the force-balance equation will be a “damped” oscillation, that is an oscillation that decreases in amplitude over time as friction draws energy out of the system (and dissipates it as heat). But how fast and in what form will the amplitude decrease? Question A Suppose that friction is strong, that is \\(a\\) is big. More specifically, suppose \\(a^2 &gt; 4 b\\). What will be true about \\(\\sqrt{\\strut a^2 - 4b}\\)? It will be purely “imaginary”.︎✘ It will be purely “real”.Excellent!  It will be complex, that is with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part.︎✘ There’s no way to tell for sure.︎✘ Question B When \\(a^2 &gt; 4b\\), can either of the eigenvalues be positive? NoRight!  Yes, one eigenvalue can be positive.︎✘ Both eigenvalues must be positive.︎✘ Depends on the specific values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).︎✘ When friction dominates (that is, large \\(|a|\\)) the eigenvalues are both real and negative. This means there is no oscillation and the motion decays to \\(x = 0\\). Question C Question: Suppose that friction is weak, that is \\(a^2 &lt; 4|b|\\). What will be true about \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + 4b}\\)? It will be purely “imaginary”.Excellent!  It will be purely “real”.︎✘ It will be complex, that is with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part.︎✘ There’s no way to tell for sure.︎✘ Suppose that we define \\(\\omega \\equiv \\sqrt{\\strut 4b - a^2}/2\\) and \\(k = a/2\\). (Recall, that for \\(a\\) to describe friction, we must have \\(a &lt; 0\\).) The eigenvalues will be of the form \\({k + i\\omega}\\) and a solution to the differential equation will be \\(e^{(k + i\\omega)t} = e^{kt} e^{ i \\omega t}\\). Question D What will \\(e^{-kt} e^{i \\omega t}\\) be? An exponentially decaying sinusoidNice!  An exponentially growing sinusoid︎✘ Remember that \\(a &gt; 0\\), so \\(k = a/2 &gt; 0\\) and \\(e^{-kt}\\) is a decaying exponential. An ordinary sinusoid.︎✘ Exercise 53.07: Yn47ct Section 54.1 gives the equations for the motion of a cannonball with a simple model of air resistance and shows how to integrate them numerically with integrateODE(). You task is to set the initial conditions for velocity so that the ball is being fired 250 feet per second at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal. These initial conditions will be \\(v_0 = 250 \\sin\\left(\\strut \\pi \\theta/180\\right)\\) and \\(u_0 = 250 \\cos\\left(\\strut \\pi \\theta/180\\right)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) has units of degrees. Once you have the numerical integration working, find an argmin for \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the horizontal distance travelled by the cannonball. Exercise 53.09: iX26Ra Most any mathematics textbook devotes a considerable amount of space to deriving formulas. This is well and good. But in practical work, there is considerable room for error even if you already know the formula. It’s a good professional practice to try to have at least two ways to perform a calculation so that you can confirm that you are doing the calculation properly. In this exercise, we give you a formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an abcd matrix. And, of course, there is the eigen() function that should give the same results as the formula. Your task is to use both eigen() and the formulas directly to confirm that the two calculations are the same. The formulas have symbols; replace these with numbers of your choice to do the calculations. You might start out with numbers that are simple integers, then switch to numbers that are more or less random. The formula for the eigenvalues of an abcd matrix \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a &amp; b\\\\c &amp; d\\end{array}\\right]\\] is \\[\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[{\\large\\strut}(a-d)^2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut(a+d)^2 - 4bc}\\right]\\ .\\] Once you know the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors can be calculated this way: \\[\\vec{\\Lambda_1} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_1 - d\\\\c\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\vec{\\Lambda_2} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_2 - d\\\\c\\end{array}\\right]\\] Exercise 53.11: Pl64dp An eigenvector \\(\\vec{\\Lambda}\\) of a matrix \\(\\mathit{M}\\) always has this property: \\[\\mathit{M} \\vec{\\Lambda} = \\lambda \\vec{\\Lambda}\\] This merely says that if you multiply a matrix by one of its eigenvectors, the result is a vector that points in the same direction as the eigenvector but may have a different length or reversed orientation. Your task: Construct a numerical abcd matrix with whatever values you like and, using eigen(), calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Multiply the matrix by one of the eigenvectors to create a new vector. Confirm that the vector in (2) is proportional to the eigenvector. When two vectors are proportional, dividing component-wise one vector by the other will create a vector with every element the same. (Note: if both of the vectors in the division have any zero component, the result of the division will be NaN. In contrast, if one of the vectors has a zero component, but the other doesn’t, you will get a result of 0 or Inf for that component.) Exercise 53.13: JsRKvA You’ve seen that sometimes the two eigenvalues of an abcd matrix are complex numbers, that is, have a nonzero imaginary part. You may also have noticed that the eigenvalues are closely related to one another: the imaginary part of one will be the negative of the imaginary part of the other. Such vectors are called complex conjugates. Whenever a matrix has a complex eigenvalue, it will also have the complex conjugate of that eigenvalue; complex eigenvalues always come in pairs. For a 2x2 matrix, there will be two eigenvalues. If one is complex, the other will be the complex conjugate. For a 3x3 matrix, either one or all three of the eigenvalues will not be complex. Here’s a way to generate a random nxn matrix: n &lt;- 3 M &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n^2), nrow=n) eigen(M)$values ## [1] -1.0116945 0.8665988 0.3070530 Your task: for \\(n=3\\), run the previous commands over and over, 20 times altogether. Report what fraction of the time the random matrix generated has 3 real eigenvalues. (Note: Something like 1.548950+0.00000i is a real eigenvalue, because the imaginary part is zero.) Exercise 53.15: xkQnvD The only fixed point of the rabbit-fox system is \\(\\left(r^\\star, f^\\star\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}, -\\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}\\right)\\) The linearized dynamics around this fixed point are: \\[\\partial_t r = \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right) [r - r^\\star] + \\alpha [f - f^\\star]\\\\ \\partial_t f = - \\delta [r - r^\\star] + \\left(\\delta + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{\\delta}\\right) [f - f^\\star]\\] Using the formula for eigenvalues, calculate the eigenvalues symbolically and report on the stability of the fixed point. Exercise 53.17: CMBvRg Let’s plot \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) over the domain \\(0 &lt; t &lt; 10\\) using \\(\\omega = 2\\). We need to be a little careful, since our plotting functions are not arranged to display complex numbers. But there is an easy workaround: plot the “real” and “imaginary” parts separately. f &lt;- makeFun(exp(1i * omega * t) ~ t, omega = 2) slice_plot(Re(f(t)) ~ t, domain(t=c(0, 10)), color = &quot;magenta&quot;) %&gt;% slice_plot(Im(f(t)) ~ t, color=&quot;brown&quot;) Question A Which part of \\(e^{i \\omega t}\\) is the cosine function?

Make an estimate of how long the rope is (specifically the length of the rope from the climber’s harness to the bolts at the top of the route), based on the eigenvalues of the linear dynamics of swinging. The standard differential-equation model for the changing angle \\(\\theta\\) of a pendulum is \\[L \\partial_{tt} \\theta = - g \\theta\\] where \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum (in meters) and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 on the Earth’s surface).

Exercise 53.21: PD3CiZ In this exercise, you’ll be using an app that allows you to set \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the [ab10] matrix and hunt for eigenvectors. Open up the app in another browser tab and arrange it side-by-side with this document, so you can see both at the same time. You used a somewhat similar app when exploring linear, two-dimensional finite-difference equations. Here’s a link, but you don’t need to open that app for this exercise. This new app does a few things differently: In the old app, you had four number-entry boxes to set the values of the [abcd] matrix. Here, because we’re using the [ab10] format, you need only set \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). You can do this by clicking within the left-hand graph. The a-b selector graph is annotated with the type of generic behavior that the differential-equation system will show for any combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This allows you to reason backward from the behavior you are interested in to the corresponding values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the type of behavior is encoded in the eigenvalues, you are effectively inverting the eigenvalue formula to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The flow field (right-hand graph) shows stream-lines of continuous-time motion. Imagine you had a bunch of glitter which you cast out over a pool of water with a given flow pattern. If you took a time-exposure photo, you would see each piece of glitter as it moved along with the water in which it is embedded. You can click in the flow field to start a trajectory at that point. You can control the time domain—that is, how long is the time exposure of the photo—with the radio buttons at the bottom. There is a thin, green line annotating the flow field. This line runs from the fixed point (right in the center) in the direction of the point on which you click to start a trajectory. A vector with the same orientation as the green line is given numerically below the graph. This orientation is also described using an angle measurement in degrees. There is no display of the solution, that is, \\(x()\\) versus \\(t\\). This is because we want you to understand the geometry of the flow. First, play around with the app. Choose miscellaneous values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), observe the flow, and click in the flow field to draw a red trajectory. Notice what happens when you make the number of steps larger or smaller. In unstable directions, you can get a good view of the trajectory by starting it near the fixed point. If you start it at the periphery of the graph, most of the trajectory will be outside the display. And if the number of steps is very small, you may not see it at all because the glyph is so thin near the start. When coming from a stable direction, click near the periphery of the graph to get a good view, since the red trajectory will naturally be heading in towards the origin. When estimating the orientation of an eigenvector, try to get the green line heading straight down the middle of the red trajectory. This often requires a bit of fiddling, moving the starting point just a tiny amount to find one that is just right. When you are on an eigenvector, the trajectory will be dead straight on the green line. Any trajectory not starting on an eigenvector will be curved to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the relative sizes of the eigenvalues. In the following questions, pick the choice closest to the answer you found. The exact choice of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) stemming from a click depends somewhat on the graphics resolution of your display, so you should expect only to be able to get close to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values given in the question. Question A Set \\(a=-1.0\\) and \\(b = 0.5\\) (or as close as you can get) and observe the flow. This is a saddle: stable in one direction, unstable in another. There will be one stable eigenvector, where the flow moves directly outward from the origin, and one unstable eigenvector, where the flow moves directly inward toward the origin.

Question K Keeping \\(a=-1\\) and \\(b = -1\\), what can you correctly say about the eigenvectors?

There are no eigenvectorsCorrect. This is true in the sense that there is no place where the motion is on a straight line toward or away from the origin. Question L Staying with the flow from \\(a=2\\) and \\(b = -0.5\\), which of these best describes the pair of eigenvalues? Both are real and positiveCorrect.  Both are real and negative︎✘ One is complex, the other real︎✘ Both are complex, one has negative real part︎✘ Both are complex, both have negative real part︎✘ Question M Set \\(a=0\\) and some \\(b &lt; 0\\). The result will be a trajectory that goes around in a closed loop. (You will want to make the number of steps large to see a complete loop.) You may not be able to click on exactly \\(a=0\\), but you should be able to get close enough that the trajectory is a very tightly wound spiral. We’re interested here in how many cycles the trajectory covers in a fixed number of time steps, that is, whether the trajectory moves quickly or slowly around the loop. Which of these statements is true about the relationship between \\(b\\) and the speed of the motion? There’s no relationship between \\(b\\) and speed of oscillation.︎✘ When \\(b\\) is closer to zero, the speed is higher.︎✘ When \\(b\\) is further from zero, the speed is higher.Right!  Question N We’re going to look at the relationship between the eigenvalues and the speed of oscillation. Keep \\(a=0\\) and \\(b &lt; 0\\), which guarantees that the motion will be circular. Vary \\(b\\), each time observing how many loops the trajectory makes (for a fixed number of steps), and what the eigenvalues are. Which of these statements is not true about the speed of oscillation and the eigenvalues. The larger the magnitude of the imaginary part of the eigenvalues, the faster the oscillation.︎✘ The two eigenvalues have exactly the same imaginary part, except one is positive and the other negative.︎✘ The speed of oscillation relates to the difference between the imaginary part of the eigenvalues.Good.  The real part of the eigenvalues is the same for both when there is oscillatory motion.︎✘ Exercise 53.23: 6OL44y We are studying linear continuous-time dynamics near a fixed point using a simplified matrix: \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a &amp; b\\\\1 &amp; 0\\end{array}\\right] \\ \\ \\ \\text{instead of the fully parameterized system}\\ \\ \\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a &amp; b\\\\c &amp; d\\end{array}\\right]\\] We’re doing this because it makes the algebra easier—two parameters rather than four—and because it has a stronger connection to another format for differential equations which we’ll study under the name “force-balance equations.” But what do we lose by dropping two parameters? You’ve seen a small set of generic behavior in flows near a fixed point: saddles, sources, sinks, oscillation. Are there other types of generic behavior that appear in the 4-parameter system but not the 2-parameter one? To answer this question, we’ll return to the app that displays flows: You can see in the ab-selector graph on the left annotations for several types of generic behaviour: Saddle (unstable along one eigenvector, stable along the other) Sources (unstable along both eigenvectors) Sinks (stable along both eigenvectors) Stable oscillation (spirals toward the fixed point) Unstable oscillation (spirals away from the fixed point) In the ab-selector graph, these are encoded by color and shading. The blue parabola marks the ab-region of oscillation; stability is indicated using dark shading. Saddles are at the top of the ab-graph. Sources and sinks are the gray arches rising up from the edges of the graph. The shading is set by calculating the eigenvalues for each (a, b)-pair Underneath the graph are two numeric-input widgets, one to set the \\(c\\) parameter, the other to set \\(d\\). By default, these are set to display an [ab10] matrix, but you can change them. Play with the \\(c\\)- and \\(d\\)-inputs to see how that changes the flow field (right graph) and the shaded regions. Make small changes to \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) at first to get a feeling for what the controls do to the display. Then you can explore large changes. The question you are to answer is this: Does any new behavior appear when \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are moved from their [ab10] settings? Essay: Describe in a couple of dozen words the results of your explorations in \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). It’s remarkable that the same \\(m\\) appears both in Newton’s Second Law and in the description of the force of gravity. There was no mathematical theory for this until Albert Einstein (1879-1955)↩︎ Another bit of physics which is still not included in the differential equation is that it will only hold until the object hits the ground, at which point the force of gravity will be counter-acted by the force of the ground on the object.↩︎ "],["forcing.html", "Chapter 55 Forcing and resonance 55.1 Car following dynamics", " Chapter 55 Forcing and resonance Harmonic Oscillator Forcing and resonance maybe return to the cruise control stability problem, putting in disturbances from the car in front. 55.1 Car following dynamics # random forcing of unit variance Pts &lt;- tibble::tibble( t = seq(0,1000, by=0.5), y = rnorm(length(t)) ) random_forcing &lt;- spliner(y ~ t, data = Pts) slice_plot(random_forcing(t/5) ~ t, domain(t=0:100)) traj &lt;- integrateODE( dx ~ -r*(x-x0) -(v - (vf+3*random_forcing(t/8))), dv ~ b*(x-x0), dtime ~ 1, vf = 100, # feet/second x0 = 150, # feet b = .25, # per second, r = .5, # damping x = 125, v = 110, time = 0, tdur = list(to=300, dt=0.01)) traj_plot(v(t) ~ t, traj, domain=domain(t=0:300)) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
