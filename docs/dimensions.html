<p>Next time you’re at a family gathering with your 10-year old cousin, give her the following math quiz. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1700" href="#1700"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1700" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1700</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What’s 3 + 2?</li>
<li>What’s 7 - 3?</li>
<li>What’s 3 miles + 2 miles?</li>
<li>What’s 3 miles + 2 kilometers?</li>
<li>What’s 3 miles + 2 kilograms?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know your cousin, but I suspect she will have an easy time answering (1) and (2) correctly. As for (3), she might give the correct answer, “5 miles,” or just say “5.” If so, you’ll follow up with “5 what?” at which point she’ll definitely say “miles.”</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>is a bit harder. You might need to prompt her with the information that 1 kilometer is about 0.6 miles. Then, if she’s pretty smart, she’ll answer “4.2 miles.”</li>
</ol>
<p>10-year olds are pretty creative, so I’m not sure how she’ll answer (5). But if you ask your Ph.D. aunt, she’ll answer along the lines of “silly question,” or “there’s no such thing.” That’s true.</p>
<p>Consider these everyday quantities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>60 miles per hour: a typical <em>speed</em> for driving on a highway</li>
<li>2106 square feet: the in-bounds <em>area</em> for a court used for singles tennis.</li>
<li>375 cubic centimeters: the <em>volume</em> in a canned beverage (in the US).</li>
<li>2.5 gallons per minute: the US mandated maximum <em>flow rate</em> for water through a shower head.</li>
<li>35 miles per gallon: a typical fuel economy for a small car in the US.</li>
<li>Your body mass index: measure your mass then divide by the square of your height.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider how you would measure such things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>We ordinarily use a speedometer to measure instantaneous car speed and police use a radar gun. But fundamentally, you measure the distance traveled and the time used and divide distance by time.</li>
<li>Most people would rely on the internet for this information, but you would check your local court by measuring the width (27 feet is the standard) and the length of the course (78). Multiply the two.</li>
<li>Pour the beverage into a measuring cup and read off the volume. But more fundamentally, you could measure the circumference of the can (<span class="math inline">\(2 \pi r\)</span>), square it (<span class="math inline">\(4 \pi^2 r^2\)</span>) and divide by <span class="math inline">\(4 \pi\)</span> to get the cross section area of the can. Then multiply that by the height of the can.</li>
<li>We don’t usually monitor water use by a shower. But if you need to, get a 5-gallon pail (the standard volume of the plastic pails used for so many purposes in construction), put it under the shower head, and measure the time it takes to fill the pail. Divide volume by the time.</li>
<li>Record the mileage on the car’s odometer when you fill up the car with gas. Drive. When you next get gas, measure the new odometer reading and the volume of gas you purchased. Divide the change in odometer reading by the gas volume. (In Europe, you would divide the gas volume by the change in odometer reading.)</li>
<li>Weigh yourself. The scale is usually graduated in both pounds and kilograms: take your choice. Measure your height; the ruler-in-the-doorway method works well. Then divide your weight by the square of your height.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidently, it makes sense to <em>multiply</em> and <em>divide</em> different types of quantities: feet, gallons, kilometers, kilograms, pounds, hours, …. But you won’t ever see a quantity constructed by <em>adding</em> or <em>subtracting</em> miles and hours or gallons and and square feet. You can square feet and cube centimeters, but can you take the square root of a gallon? Does it make sense to raise 2 to the power of 3 yards? <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1710" href="#1710"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1710" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1710</span></span></p>
<p>This section is about the mathematical structure of combining quantities; which kinds of mathematical operations are legitimate and which are not.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The first step in understanding the mathematics of quantity is to make an absolute distinction between two concepts that, in everyday life, are used interchangeably: <strong><em>dimension</em></strong> and <strong><em>unit</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Length</em></strong> is a dimension. Meters is a unit of length. We also measure length in microns, mm, cm, inches, feet, yards, kilometers, and miles, to say nothing of furlongs, fathoms, astronomical units (AU), and parsecs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Time</em></strong> is a dimension. Seconds is a unit of time. We also measure time in micro-seconds, milli-seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, millenia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mass</em></strong> is a dimension. Kilograms is a unit of mass.</p>
<p>Length, time, and mass are called <strong><em>fundamental dimensions</em></strong>. This is not because length is more important than area or volume. It’s because you can construct area and volume by multiplying lengths together. This is evident when you consider units of area like square-inches or cubic centimeters, but obscured in the names of units like acre, liter, gallon.</p>
<p>We’ll use the notation L, T, and M to refer to the fundamental dimensions. (Electrical charge Q is also a fundamental dimension, but we won’t have much use for it in our examples.)</p>
</div>
<div id="compound-dimensions" class="section level2" number="16.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Compound dimensions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#compound-dimensions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are other dimensions: volume, force, pressure, energy, torque, velocity, acceleration, and such. These are called <strong><em>compound dimensions</em></strong> because we represent them as combinations of the fundamental dimensions, L, T, and M. The notation for these combinations involves multiplication and division. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume is L <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> L <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> L <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> L<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>, as in “cubic centimeters”</li>
<li>Velocity is L/T, as in “miles per hour”</li>
<li>Force is M L/T<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, which is obscure unless you remember Newton’s Second Law that <span class="math inline">\(\text{F} = \text{m}\,\text{a}\)</span>: “force equals mass times acceleration.” In terms of dimension, mass is M, acceleration is L/T<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Multiply the two together and you get the dimension “force.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiplication and division are used to construct a compound dimension from the fundamental dimensions L, T, and M.</p>
<p>Addition and subtraction are <strong>never</strong> used to form a compound dimension.</p>
<p>Much of the work in understanding dimensions involves overcoming the looseness of everyday speech. Remember the weight scale graduated in pounds <em>and</em> kilograms. The unit kilograms is a way of measuring M, but the unit of pounds is a way of measuring <em>force</em>: M L/T<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Weight is not the same as mass. This makes no sense to most people and doesn’t really matter in everyday life. It’s only when you venture off the surface of the Earth that the difference shows up. A person in orbit is “weightless” but that person continues to have mass. The weight of a woman on Mars is different from her weight on Earth but her martian mass is exactly the same as her earthly mass. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1720" href="#1720"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1720" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1720</span></span></p>
<p>Another source of confusion carried over from everyday life is that sometimes we measure the same quantity using different dimensions. You can measure a volume by <em>weighing</em> water; a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, a liter of water has a mass of 1 kg. Serious bakers measure flour by weight; a casual baker uses a measuring cup. We can measure water volume with length because water has a (more-or-less) constant mass density. But 8 pounds of gasoline is considerably more than a gallon. It turns out that the density of flour varies substantially depending on how it’s packed, on humidity, etc. This is why it matters whether you weigh flour for baking or measure it by volume. You can measure time by the swing of a pendulum. To measure the same time successfully with different pendula they need to have the same length, not the same mass.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>unit</em></strong> is a conventional amount of a quantity of a given dimension. All lengths are the same dimensionally, but they can be measured with different conventions: inches, hards, meters, … Units for the same dimension can all be converted unambiguously one into the other. A meter is exactly the same quantity of length as 39.3701 inches, a mile is the same length as 1609.34 meters. Liters and gallons are both units of volume (L<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>): a gallon is the same as 3.78541 liters.</p>
<p>You will hear it said that a kilogram is 2.2 pounds. That’s not strictly true. A kilogram has dimension M and a pound has dimension ML/T<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Quantities with different dimensions cannot be “equal” or even legitimately compared to one another. Unless you bring something else into the game that physically changes the situation, for instance gravity (dimension of acceleration due to gravity (dimension <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}/\text{T}^2\)</span>). The <em>weight</em> of a kilogram on the surface of the Earth is is 2.2 pounds because gravitational acceleration is (almost) the same everywhere on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>It’s also potentially confusing that sometimes different dimensions are used to get at the same idea. For instance, the same car that gets 35 miles / gallon in the US (dimension <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}/\text{L}^3 = 1/\text{L}^2\)</span>) will use 6.7 liters per 100 kilometers (<span class="math inline">\(\text{L}^3 / L = \text{L}^2\)</span>) in Europe. Same car. Same fuel. Different conventions using different dimensions. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1730" href="#1730"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1730" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1730</span></span></p>
<p>Keeping track of the various compound dimensions can be tricky. For many people, it’s easier to keep track of the physical relationships involved and use that knowledge to put together the dimensions appropriately. Often, the relationship can be described using specific calculus operations, so knowing dimensions and units helps you use calculus successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll use a specific bracket notation to translate between words for the concept and the dimension. For instance, [length] = L, [mass] = M, [time] = T, [inches] = L, …</p>
<p>Easy compound dimensions that you likely already know:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>[<strong><em>Area</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{L}^2\)</span>. Some corresponding units to remind you: “square feet,” “square miles,” “square centimeters.”</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Volume</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{L}^3\)</span>. Units to remind you: “cubic centimeters,” “cubic feet,” “cubic yards.” (What landscapers informally call a “yard,” for instance “10 yards of topsoil” should properly be called “10 cubic-yards of topsoil.”)</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Velocity</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{L}/\text{T}\)</span>. Units: “miles per hour,” “inches per second.”</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Momentum</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{M}\text{L}/\text{T}\)</span>. Units: “kilogram meters per second.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Anticipating that you will return to this section for reference, we’ve also added some dimensions that can be understood through the relevant calculus operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>[<strong><em>Acceleration</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{L}/\text{T}^2\)</span>. Units: “meters per second squared,” In calculus, acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, or, equivalently, the 2nd derivative of position with respect to time.</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Force</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{M}\, \text{L}/\text{T}^2\)</span> In calculus: force is the derivative of momentum with respect to time.</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Energy</em></strong>] or [<strong><em>Work</em></strong>] <span class="math inline">\(= \text{M}\, \text{L}^2/\text{T}^2\)</span> In calculus, energy is the integral of force with respect to length.</li>
<li>[<strong><em>Power</em></strong>] $= , <sup>2/</sup>3 $ In calculus, power is the derivative of energy with respect to time.</li>
</ul>
<div class="intheworld">
<p><strong><em>Density</em></strong> sounds like a specific concept, but there are many different kinds of densities. These have in common that they are a ratio of a physical amount to a geometric extent: <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1740" href="#1740"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1740" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1740</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>a physical amount: which might be mass, charge, people, etc.</li>
<li>a geometric extent: which might be length, area, or volume.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“paper weight” is the mass per area, typically grams-per-square-meter</li>
<li>“charge density” is the amount of electrical charge, usually per area or volume</li>
<li>“lineal density of red blood cells” is the number of cells in a capillary divided by the length of the capillary. (Capillaries are narrow. Red blood cells go through one after the other.)</li>
<li>“population density” is people per area of ground.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="intheworld">
<p>The theory of dimensions and units was developed for the physical sciences. Consequently the fundamental dimensions are those of physics: length, mass, time, electrical current, luminous intensity.</p>
<p>Since proper use of units is important even outside the physical sciences, it’s helpful to recognize several other kinds of quantity as dimensions.</p>
<p>“people”/“passengers”/“customers”/“patients”/“children”/“students”/“professors” — these are different dimensions and not really units: no fixed translation between them as you would have with units.
“money”: Units are dollars (in many varieties: US, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand), euros, yuan (synonym: renminbi), yen, pounds (many varieties: UK, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan and South Sudan), pesos (many varieties), dinar, franc (Swiss, CFA), rand, riyal, rupee, won, and many others. Conversion rates depend on situation and national policy.</p>
<p>Examples: Passenger-miles is a standard unit of transport. Passenger-miles-per-dollar is an appropriate unit of the economic efficiency of transport. Passenger-deaths per million passenger-mile is one way to describe the risk of transport.</p>

</h2>
<p>We want to relate the <strong>period</strong> (in T) of a pendulum to it’s <strong>length</strong> and <strong>mass</strong>. Acceleration due to <strong>gravity</strong> also plays a role; that has dimension <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}\cdot \text{T}^{-2}\)</span>. For simplicity, we’ll assume that only the bob at the end of the pendulum cable or rod has mass. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1750" href="#1750"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1750" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1750</span></span></p>
<p>The analysis strategy is to combine the four quantities we think play a role into one total quantity that is <strong>dimensionless</strong>. Since it is dimensionless, it can be constant regardless of the mass, length, period, gravity of each individual situation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{[Period]}^a \cdot \mbox{[Mass]}^b \cdot \mbox{[Length]}^c \cdot \mbox{[Gravity]}^d = T^a \cdot M^b \cdot L^c \cdot L^d \cdot T^{-2d} = [1]\]</span>
To be dimensionless:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(c = -d\)</span>, cancel out the L</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(a = 2d\)</span>, cancel out the T</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(b=0\)</span>, there’s no other mass term, and we need to cancel out the M</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the exponents can be put in terms of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. That doesn’t tell us what <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> should be, but whatever value for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> we decide to choose, we get a ratio that’s equivalent to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{\mbox{Gravity}\cdot \mbox{Period}^2}{\mbox{Length}} \equiv B\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the size of the dimensionless quantity [1]. Consequently</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Period} = B \sqrt{\frac{\mbox{Length}}{\mbox{Gravity}} }\]</span>
We can experimentally determine the numerical value of the dimensionless constant <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by measuring the period and length of a pendulum and (on Earth) recognizing that gravitational acceleration on Earth’s surface is 9.8 meters-per-second-squared. Such experiment and mathematical models using differential equations give <span class="math inline">\(B = (2\pi)^2\)</span>.</p>

</span></summary><p>This activity will apply some of the concepts and techniques you’re learning to answer the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How fast does a satellite move along its orbit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, the answer is already known and you could look it up. The point of our reconstructing what is already known is to see the totality of a modeling project, even if it is a very simple one.</p>
<p>In textbooks and in-class demonstrations, students are often shown complete, flawless models. In reality, model construction is a matter of trial and error. Whoops! We’re supposed to say “modeling cycle.” That phrase doesn’t suggest anything about “error.” But in reality, modelers make mistakes, operate under misconceptions, collect erroneous data, misunderstand the purpose of building a model, and make all sorts of mistakes. To cope with this unhappy situation, good modelers are constantly checking and testing their models for inconsistencies.</p>
<p>To start, you should have</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>A good idea of what the eventual answer will be</strong>. Often, that idea comes from somewhat vague and imprecise knowledge. For example, you may have heard that it takes a satellite in low orbit about 90 minutes to complete one circuit of the Earth. You may also know that the length of the equator is roughly 40,000 kilometers. (This is actually the original definition of the meter.) A velocity is distance traveled over time, so a satellite in low orbit has a velocity of roughly <span class="math inline">\(40000 / 90\)</span> km/minute, which comes out to 7400 meters/second.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>theory</strong> that relates what you want to know to what you already know. For our purposes, that theory comes directly from Isaac Newton in the 1680s: his laws of motion and his theory of universal gravitation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The theory</strong></p>
<p>We won’t assume that you have anything more than a vague understanding of Newton’s laws and theory of gravitation. The diagram shows the situation schematically.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="Exercises/Dimension/www/orbit-force.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>The satellite is traveling clockwise along a curved trajectory encircling the Earth. The position of the satellite is shown at several times by the numbered blue dots. Let’s focus on the satellite at time 1.</p>
<p>The satellite is an object in motion. Newton’s First Law (“Lex I”) is stated in his 1687 book, <em>Philosophiae Naturis Principia Mathematica</em> (Mathematical principles of natural philosophy) on p.12</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="Exercises/Dimension/www/principia.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Translating into English, this is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Law I: <em>Every body persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled to change that motion by forces impressed upon it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dashed line connecting the points labeled 1 and 2’ shows the path that the satellite would follow <em>if there were no forces impressed upon it</em>.</p>
<p>Yet there is a force impressed on the satellite: the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the satellite. This force accelerates the satellite perpendicular to its orbit (toward the center of the Earth) causing the satellite to follow a curved path rather than a straight path off into deep space. The acceleration of the satellite traveling at constant speed in orbit depends on both the velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of the satellite and the radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> of its orbit.</p>
<p><strong>Task #1:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> be the acceleration needed to keep the satellite in a circular orbit. Find a plausible relationship between <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. One possibility is that the relationship is a general product of the form <span class="math display">\[A_1 = v^n\ r^m .\]</span> Use dimensional analysis to find <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Recall that acceleration has dimension L/T<span class="math inline">\(^{2}\)</span>, velocity has dimension <span class="math inline">\(L/T\)</span> and radius has dimension L.</p>
<p>Once you determine <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, write down the relationship <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we all know, gravity pulls all objects toward the center of the Earth. The acceleration <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> due to gravity on an object a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from the enter of the Earth is proportional to the mass of the Earth and is known to be <span class="math display">\[A_2  = G\ M_e/r^2\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a constant of proportionality and <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span> is the mass of Earth.</p>
<p>In order for the satellite to stay in orbit, the two accelerations <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> (what’s needed to stay in orbit) and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> (what the Earth’s gravity provides) must be equal.</p>
<p><strong>Task #2:</strong> Set your expression for <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> equal to the expression for <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> and solve for the velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of the satellite (our original objective for this exercise). Your answer will involve <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Use the known numerical values for <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span> given in the next section to check that your answer makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>The data</strong></p>
<p>The data here come from scientific observations made over centuries that give us numerical values (with units) of <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in the theory.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a universal constant (according to Newton’s theory of gravitation). The quantity is given by several sources as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G = 6.674 \times 10^{−11} m^3 /(s^2 kg).\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the mass of the Earth is given as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M_e  = 5.972 × 10^{24} kg\]</span></p>
<p>These reported facts seem plausible, but it’s a good practice to check. Toward that end, check</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The dimension and units of <span class="math inline">\(A_2(v, r)\)</span> are consistent.</li>
<li>The value of <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> at the Earth’s surface is consistent with the famous value 9.8 m/s<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Task #3:</strong> Finishing up.</p>
<p>Use the formula you derived for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span> to find <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for a satellite in low orbit around the Earth. The official extent of the “Low Earth Orbit Region” is up to 2000 km. If you were using the altitude of the International Space Station (400 km), you would set <span class="math inline">\(r = r_e + 400km\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span> is the radius of the earth: 6, 378.1 km.</p>
<p>As always, you want to do the calculation in a way that helps you to spot possible errors. Here are two good practices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You have already confirmed (or should have) that your formula for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span> is dimensionally consistent. As you plug in numerical values for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(M_e\)</span>, make sure to keep track of the <em>units</em> explicitly and that the result you get has proper units for velocity.</li>
<li>Compare your result to the rough estimate of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for satellites in low orbit that you made at the beginning of this activity. If there is a discrepancy, review both your initial rough estimate as well as your gravity-based derivation of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to figure out where the inconsistency comes from. Then fix it.</li>

</h2>
<p>Numbers are dimensionless but not necessarily unitless. Failure to accept this distinction is one of the prime reasons people have trouble figuring out how to convert from one unit to another. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1760" href="#1760"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1760" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1760</span></span></p>
<p>1 is a favorite of elementary school students because its multiplication and division tables are completely simple. Anything times one, or anything divided by one, is simply that thing. Addition and subtraction are pretty simple, too, but that’s not my concern here.</p>
<p>When it comes to <strong><em>quantities</em></strong>, there’s not just one one but many. And often they look nothing like the numeral 1. Some examples of 1 as a quantity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{180}{\pi} \frac{\text{degrees}}{\text{radians}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0.621371 \frac{\text{mile}}{\text{kilometer}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(3.78541 \frac{\text{liter}}{\text{gallon}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{9}{5} \frac{^\circ F}{^\circ C}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{12} \frac{\text{dozen}}{\text{item}}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I like to call these and others different <strong><em>flavors of one</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In every one of the above examples, the dimension of the numerator matches the dimension of the denominator. The same is true when comparing feet and meters ([feet / meter] is L/L = [1]), or comparing cups and pints ([cups / pint] is <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}^3/\text{L}^3 = [1]\)</span>) or comparing miles per hour and feet per second ([miles/hour / ft per sec] = L/T / L/T = [1]). Each of these quantities has <em>units</em> but it has no <em>dimension</em>.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to think about conversion between units as a matter of multiplying by the appropriate flavor of 1. Such conversion will not change the dimension of the quantity but will render it in new units.</p>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>Example: Convert 100 feet-per-second into miles-per-hour. First, write the quantity to be converted as a fraction and alongside it, write the desired units after the conversion. In this case that will be <span class="math display">\[100 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}} \ \ \ \text{into} \ \ \ \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\]</span></p>
<p>First, we’ll change feet into miles. This can be accomplished by multiplying by the flavor of one that has units miles-per-foot. Second, we’ll change seconds into hours. Again, a flavor of 1 is involved.</p>
<p>What number will give a flavor of one? One mile is 5280 feet, so <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{5280} \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{foot}}\]</span> is a flavor of one.</p>
<p>Next, we need a flavor of one that will turn <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{second}}\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{1}}{\text{hour}}\)</span>. We can make use of a minute being 60 seconds, and an hour being 60 minutes.
<span class="math display">\[\underbrace{\frac{60\  \text{s}}{\text{minute}}}_\text{flavor of 1}\  \underbrace{\frac{60\ \text{minutes}}{\text{hour}}}_\text{flavor of 1} = \underbrace{3600\frac{\text{s}}{ \text{hour}}}_\text{flavor of 1}\]</span></p>
<p>Multiplying our carefully selected flavors of one by the initial quantity, we get <span class="math display">\[
\underbrace{\frac{1}{5280} \frac{\text{mile}}{\text{foot}}}_\text{flavor of 1} \times \underbrace{3600 \frac{\text{s}}{\text{hour}}}_\text{flavor of 1} \times \underbrace{100 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{s}}}_\text{original quantity} = 100 \frac{3600}{5280} \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}} = 68.18 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\]</span></p>

<p>Low-order polynomials are a useful way of constructing model functions. A For instance, suppose we want a model of the yield of corn in a field per inch of rain over the growing season, will call it corn(rain). The output will have units of bushels (of corn). The input will have units of inches (of rain). A second-order polynomial will be appropriate for reasons to be discussed in Chapter <a href="#optimization1"><strong>??</strong></a>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1770" href="#1770"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1770" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1770</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{corn(rain)} \equiv a_0 + a_1\, \text{rain} + \frac{1}{2} a_2\, \text{rain}^2\]</span>
Of course, the addition in the linear combination will only make sense if all three terms <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_1\,\text{rain}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\, a_2\, \text{rain}^2/2\)</span> have the same dimension. But clearly <span class="math inline">\([\text{rain}] \neq [\text{rain}^2]\)</span>. In order for things to work out, the <strong>scalars must themselves have dimension</strong>. We know the output of the function will have dimension <span class="math inline">\([\text{volume}] = \text{L}^3\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\([a_0] = \text{L}^3\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\([a_1]\)</span> must be different, because it has to combine with the <span class="math inline">\([\text{rain}] = \text{L}\)</span> and produce <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}^3\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\([a_1] = \text{L}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\([a_2] = \text{L}\)</span>. Multiplying that by <span class="math inline">\([\text{rain}]^2\)</span> will give the required <span class="math inline">\(\text{L}^3\)</span></p>

<div class="intheworld">
<p>In everyday communication as well as in most domains such as construction, geography, navigation, and astronomy we measure angles in <strong><em>degrees</em></strong>. 90 degrees is a right angle. But in mathematics, the unit of angle is <strong><em>radians</em></strong> where a right angle is 1.5708 radians. (1.5708 is the decimal version of <span class="math inline">\(\pi/2\)</span>.) The conversion function, which we’ll call raddeg(), is <span class="math display">\[\mbox{raddeg}(r) \equiv \frac{180}{\pi} r\]</span> The function that converts degrees to radians, which we’ll call degrad() is very similar: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{degrad}(d) \equiv \frac{\pi}{180} d\]</span>
(Incidentally, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{180}{\pi} = 57.296\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi}{180} = 0.017453\)</span>.)</p>
<p>In traditional notation, the trigonometric functions such as <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tan()\)</span> can be written with an argument either in degrees or radians. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(\sin(90^\circ) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\)</span>. Similarly, for the inverse functions like <span class="math inline">\(\arccos()\)</span> the units of the output are not specified. This works because there is always a human to intervene between the written expression and the eventual computation.</p>
<p>In R, as in many other computer languages like Python or spreadsheet packages, there is no valid expression like <code>sin(90 deg)</code>. In these languages, <code>90 deg</code> is not a valid expression (although it might be good if there were valid!). In these and many other languages, angles are always given in radians. Such consistency is admirable, but people are not always so consistent. It is a common source of computer bugs that angles in degrees are handed off to functions like <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> and that the output of <span class="math inline">\(\arccos()\)</span> is (wrongly) interpreted as degrees rather than radians. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1780" href="#1780"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1780" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1780</span></span></p>
<p>Function composition to the rescue!</p>

Where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is zero at the midnight marking New Years and increases by 1 per day. (The <span class="math inline">\(n+10\)</span> has units of days and translates New Years back 10 days, to the day of the winter solstice.) <span class="math inline">\(\delta_\odot()\)</span> gives the declination of the sun: the latitude pieced by an imagined line connecting the centers of the earth and the sun.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia formula is well written in that it uses some familiar numbers to help the reader see where the formula comes from. 365 is recognizably the length of the year in days. <span class="math inline">\(360^\circ\)</span> is the angle traversed when making a full cycle around a circle. <span class="math inline">\(23.44^\circ\)</span> is less familiar, but the student of geography might recognize it as the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer, the latitude farthest north where the sun is directly overhead at noon (on the day of the summer solstice).</p>

<p>The surface area <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of a mammal is reasonably well approximated by the function <span class="math display">\[S(M) \equiv k M^{2/3}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the body mass (in kg) and the constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> depends on the particular species under consideration.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(M^{2/3}\)</span> is <strong>not an allowed arithmetic operation</strong>. <span class="math inline">\([M] = \mbox{mass}\)</span>, and mass, like any other dimension, cannot be raised to a non-integer power. More properly, the expression should be written <span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{M}{1\  kg}\right)^{2/3}\]</span> The division by “1 kg” renders dimensionless the quantity in the parentheses: <span class="math display">\[\left[\frac{M}{1\  kg}\right] = 1\]</span>
In order to render the quantity both dimensionless and <em>unitless</em>, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> should be specified in kg. The usual practice is to skip the “1 kg” business and simply say, “Where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is in kg.” You will see such notation frequently in your career and should take care to use the indicated units.</p>
<p>You’ll need to open a computing sandbox to do the calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> Consider a baby and an adult. The adult’s mass is <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> times greater than the baby’s. Then the adult’s surface area is …?</p>

<p><strong>Question B</strong> Consider a human of body mass 70 kg with a skin surface area of 18,600 cm<sup>2</sup>. Which of the following units for the constant of proportionality <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is correct?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

</li>
<li>kg<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Would this produce <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> for the result? </span>

</ol>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> In the units of part (B), which value is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> closest to?</p>
<p>    1<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ </span>       10<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ </span>       100<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ </span>       1000<span class="mcanswer"> Excellent! </span></p>
<p>The numerical value of the constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> changes depending on what units you want to express it in. The value you found in part (C) works for masses stated in kg and skin areas in cm<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to figure out a value of <span class="math inline">\(k'\)</span> that you can use in the formula for people who are used to talking about skin area in square inches and mass in pounds. The units of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are cm<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, and we want the units of <span class="math inline">\(k'\)</span> to be in<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. That part is easy: just multiply <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by two flavors of one to change the units from cm to inches, like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k' = k\ \underbrace{\frac{\text{in}}{2.6 \text{cm}}}_\text{flavor of 1}\  \underbrace{\frac{\text{in}}{2.6 \text{cm}}}_\text{flavor of 1} = \frac{k}{2.6^2}\]</span> where the flavor of 1 reflects that 1 inch is 2.6 cm.</p>
<p><strong>But this is not the whole story</strong>. We have to be very careful in dealing with the <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{M}{1 kg}\right)^{2/3}\)</span>. Translated to pounds, <span class="math inline">\(M = 70\ \text{kg} = 154\ \text{lbs}\)</span>, since, in the rough-and-ready way everyday people express themselves, 1 kg <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 2.2 lbs.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Of course, pounds is a measure of force, not mass. But people use it as if it were mass. A mass of 70 kg corresponds to about 4.8 slugs. In Earth’s gravity, the mass 4.8 slugs produces a force of 154 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Plugging in <span class="math inline">\(M=154\)</span> lbs makes the power-law part of the formula for skin area
<span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{154\ \text{lbs}}{1\ \text{kg}}\right)^{2/3}\]</span>
You can’t take (pounds)<span class="math inline">\(^{2/3}\)</span> or (kg)<span class="math inline">\(^{2/3}\)</span>; you won’t get a sensible unit in either case. But [pounds/kg] = [1], so taking the two-thirds power of the ratio is perfectly legitimate.</p>
<p>Still, there’s a problem. Multiplying <span class="math inline">\(k\ 154^{2/3} (\text{lbs}/\text{kg})^{2/3}\)</span> has the right dimension, but strange-looking units that have nothing to do with skin area.</p>
<p>The resolution to this paradox is to multiply <span class="math inline">\(\frac{154\ \text{lbs}}{1\  \text{kg}}\)</span> by an appropriate flavor of 1 to render the dimensionless quantity unitless as well as dimensionless. This flavor will be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 \text{kg}}{2.2 lbs}\)</span>, giving a formula for skin area in square inches</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{in}(M)= \frac{k}{2.6^2}\left(\frac{154\ \bcancel{\text{lbs}}}{1\ \cancel{\text{kg}}}\ \underbrace{\frac{1\ \cancel{\text{kg}}}{2.2\ \bcancel{\text{lbs}}}}_\text{flavor of 1}\right)^{2/3} = \underbrace{\frac{k}{2.6^2}\ \left(\frac{1}{2.2}\right)^{2/3}}_{k'\ \text{for inches and pounds}} 154^{2/3}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> Optional challenge) Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(k = 1000 \text{cm}^2\)</span> when specifying mass in kilograms, what should be the numerical value of <span class="math inline">\(k'\)</span> in square-inches that should be used when body mass is given in pounds?</p>

</span></summary><p>The “Energy-maneuverability Theory” (E-M) of aircraft performance was developed by renowned fighter pilot Col John Boyd and mathematician Thomas Christie in the 1960s. The theory posits that the available maneuverability of an aircraft is closely related to its <em>specific energy</em> <span class="math inline">\(E_s\)</span>, that is, the kinetic plus potential energy of the aircraft divided by aircraft weight. To be highly maneuverable, an aircraft must be able to change it’s specific energy rapidly in time. Let’s call this ability the <em>specific power</em> (that is, power divided by mass), <span class="math inline">\(P_s\)</span>. An aircraft with large <span class="math inline">\(P_s\)</span> is more maneuverable than one with small <span class="math inline">\(P_s\)</span>.</p>
<p>An important formula in E-M Theory is <span class="math display">\[P_s = \frac{T - D}{W} V\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is aircraft thrust, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is drag, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is weight, and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is velocity. <span class="math inline">\((T-D)\)</span>, thrust minus drag, is the net forward force on the aircraft.</p>
<p>Recall these facts about the dimension of physical quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Velocity has dimension <span class="math inline">\(L^1 T^{-1}\)</span> (e.g. meters per second)</p></li>
<li><p>Acceleration has dimension <span class="math inline">\(L^1 T^{-2} =\)</span> [Velocity] <span class="math inline">\(\times\  T^{-1}\)</span> (e.g. meters per second-squared)</p></li>
<li><p>Force has dimension <span class="math inline">\(M \times\ \)</span> [Acceleration]</p></li>
<li><p>Energy has dimension [Force] <span class="math inline">\(\times\  L\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Power has dimension [Energy] <span class="math inline">\(\times\  T^{-1}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
