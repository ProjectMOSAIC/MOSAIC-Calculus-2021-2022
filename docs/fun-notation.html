<p>Part of the difficulty of mathematics for many people is making sense of the nomenclature and notation. What you were taught in high school is a highly idiomatic system that can be mastered only with extensive experience. Mathematicians are undoubtedly skilled in logic, but mathematics itself has an ancient history which has littered the language with synonyms, near synonyms, inconsistencies, diacritical marks, and letters in unfamiliar alphabets. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="500" href="#500"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 500" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">500</span></span></p>
<div class="intheworld">
<p>To illustrate the cultural admiration for abstraction in mathematics, consider this famous poem, <em>The Jabberwocky</em>, by a University of Oxford mathematician, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898):</p>
<p><em>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
       And the mome raths outgrabe.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Here are some words commonly encountered in traditional mathematics notation.</p>
<p><strong>equation</strong>, <strong>formula</strong>, <strong>function</strong>, <strong>variable</strong>, <strong>unknown</strong>, <strong>root</strong></p>
<p>And here are a few mathematical sentences.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><span class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y = \sqrt{x}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y^2 = x\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x^2 = x\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x = \sqrt{x}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>All five sentences are <em>equations</em>. That’s easy, because they each have an equal sign between the two sides. Which are <em>formulas</em>? Which are <em>functions</em>? You’re used to calling <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> <em>variables</em>. When do they become <em>unknowns</em>? Sentence (iv) might be interpreted as describing <em>roots</em>. But sentence (v) says the same thing as (iv) but would not be related to roots.<span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="510" href="#510"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 510" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">510</span></span></p>

<p>The traditional notation is practically useless for computing. A programmer has to have a deep understanding of what the notation is intended to mean in any given circumstance before she can construct a computer expression that will carry that same meaning in the computer’s work.</p>
<div class="scaffolding">
<p>To illustrate, here are some similar-looking sentences. In math notation, each of them can mean something. In R, one of them is valid and the others invalid. Read each one and try to guess which one is valid and why the others are not. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="520" href="#520"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 520" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">520</span></span></p>

<p>Once you’ve made your choice, open a <a href="https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/CalcZ-Sandbox/">SANDBOX</a> to see if you got it right.</p>
<p>Try one line at a time, and erase it before trying another line. If the code is invalid, pressing “Run code” will lead to an error message below the sandbox. The valid line will not lead to any error message.</p>
</div>
<p>The student who knows how to make sense of math notation will find this not of much help in writing computer notation. It’s like a well educated foreigner trying to make sense of how some of these sentences are meaningful and others not.</p>
<p>“Chair a meeting,” but not “seat a meeting.”
“Seat a guest,” but not “chair a guest.”<br>
“Bush yourself out,” but not “tree yourself out.”<br>
“Tree a cat,” but not “bush a cat.”<br>
“Table a motion,” but not “desk a motion.”<br>
“Bench a player,” but not “couch a player.”<br>
“Couch a meaning” but not “bench a meaning.”</p>
<p>In this book, we’re going to use a mathematical notation that corresponds to a usable computer notation. The first step is to stop using <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> to mean so many different things. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="530" href="#530"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 530" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">530</span></span></p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Words for using functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#words-for-using-functions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Throughout this course, I use the words <strong><em>inputs</em></strong> and <strong><em>output</em></strong> to refer to what is handed off to a function and what is received back as the result. But “handed off” is a metaphor and not a clear naming of what we mean when we use a function. This section simply gives some vocabulary to describe various aspects of using functions. The concept of functions is so fundamental in mathematics and computing, that there are many synonyms for each aspect. It helps to be aware of these synonyms since different people will write about functions in different—but equivalent!—ways. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="540" href="#540"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 540" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">540</span></span></p>
<p>In everyday speech, an “argument” is a discussion between people with differing views. But in computing, <strong><em>argument</em></strong> means something else entirely: it is a synonym for “input to a function.” It’s good to have a concrete image in mind, so I’ll suggest thinking of a computer printer as an analogy for a function. A computer printer takes several different kinds of input: electricity, paper, ink or toner, instructions transmitted via cable or wireless connection. Each of these inputs arrives at the printer through a particular interface: the electrical supply cord, a tray for holding paper, a tank or cartridge for ink, a radio receiver. These interfaces are the different inputs—or, to use the other word, arguments—of the printer.</p>
<p>Common sense tells you that you shouldn’t put toner in the paper tray, or connect the electrical supply cord to the ink tank. You have to provide the right kind of stuff to each input interface in order to get the anticipated output from the printer.</p>
<p>Our pattern-book functions all have a single input. With such functions it’s appropriate to speak of “the input to” or “the argument of” the function. In general, the functions we will construct for modeling purposes with have multiple inputs or arguments. For instance, the function <span class="math inline">\(g(x, y) \equiv e^x \sin(y)\)</span> has both an “x-input” and a “y-input.” You can just as well say “the x-argument of g()” or the “y-argument of g(),” or even the “first argument of g()” and the “second argument of g().” Whether you use the preposition “of” or “to” is a matter of personal style; either will do.</p>
<p>The act of employing a function to produce the output that corresponds to a given set of inputs is much like “printing a file.” Of course, the word “printing” is not the right choice for mathematical or computational functions. Instead, there are several equivalent phrases in common use:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>"<strong><em>Apply</em></strong> a function to arguments.</li>
<li>“Invoke a function.”</li>
<li>“Evaluate a function.”</li>
<li>“Run a function.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In (ii) and (iv), there is an implicit “on its arguments.” But any application/evaluation/running of a function necessarily involves giving specific values for the inputs.</p>
<p>The difference between “a function” and “applying a function” is much the same as the difference between a printer and “printing a document,” or a screwdriver and “driving (or extracting) a screw, or, for wizard-world fans, the difference between a”spell" and the act of “casting a spell.”</p>
<p>In R/mosaic, the application of a modeling function like <code>g()</code> (defined in an earlier paragraph) to its two arguments looks like <code>g(5, pi)</code> with the two arguments separated by a comma. It might also look like <code>g(z, pi)</code>, or even <code>g(x=z, y=pi)</code> or <code>g(y=pi, x=z)</code> where the use of the argument names save us the trouble of remembering which argument came first in the definition. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="550" href="#550"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 550" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">550</span></span></p>
<p>When applying a function of <strong>one</strong> argument, refrain from using the argument name. It’s unnecessary since you can hardly get the order of arguments wrong and, depending on who wrote the software for the function, they might not have used <code>x</code> as the name of the argument.</p>
<p>It’s another matter when you are <strong><em>defining</em></strong> a function. For instance, <span class="math display">\[g(x, y) \equiv e^x \sin(y)\]</span> does <strong>not</strong> mean “apply <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> to the arguments <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.” Instead, it means, “I’m setting up <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> as a function, a kind of promise in the future that whenever you write <span class="math inline">\(g(3, \pi)\)</span> or something similar, the defined function will be applied to those arguments. But for now, you don’t need to do any arithmetic or other calculation, just remember that you’ve made a promise named <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>.”</p>
<p>In R/mosaic, using a <strong><em>tilde-expression</em></strong> signals that you are asking for the same kind of promise to do something when the time for it comes.</p>
<p>Most of the time in this course, the functions you define will be described by either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>A <strong><em>formula</em></strong>, such as <code>3*x + 2</code> or <span class="math inline">\(x^2 \sin(y)\)</span>
</li>
<li>Another kind of computation of the sort not typically covered in high-school math: an iterative process, a branching process, a neural network, and so on. These processes are usually expressed using a computer programming language and so they are unfamiliar to many students.</li>
</ol>

<div id="algorithms" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Formulas and algorithms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#algorithms"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The idea of “algorithm” generalizes that of formulas. A starter definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong> is a set of instructions for performing a computation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High-school math typically involves presenting an algorithm as a formula. You learned, maybe in middle school, how to follow the arithmetic steps involved in algorithms described as formulas. You also have likely used a calculator to perform some of the arithmetic or to evaluate functions such as <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ln()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\strut}\)</span> for which you don’t know how to evaluate using simple arithmetic. The calculator is implementing an algorithm with which its been programmed to enable the calculation of <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ln()\)</span> and such.</p>
<p>A slightly more detailed definition of “algorithm” highlights that algorithms are written in terms of other, simpler algorithms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong> is a set of instructions for performing a computation written in terms of other algorithms that we already know how to perform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our purposes, the “algorithms that we already know how to perform” will be taken to be arithmetic—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division—as well as the evaluation of the pattern-book functions. Admittedly, people cannot compute logarithms as fluently as they can add numbers, but you already have the R implementations of the basic modeling functions: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">exp()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">log()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Trig.html">sin()</a></code>, power-law, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">dnorm()</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">pnorm()</a></code>.
The vast majority of functions you will see in this book (and in mathematical modeling in general) can be constructed out of basic arithmetic and the application of the pattern-book functions. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="560" href="#560"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 560" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">560</span></span></p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Algorithms without formulas<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#algorithms-without-formulas"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Many functions are described by algorithms that use concepts common in computer programming but unknown to traditional mathematical notation. Some of these have names like <strong><em>iteration</em></strong> or <strong><em>branching</em></strong> and many refer to stored lists of fixed numbers (like the office workers in the street, building, floor, corridor, door image of a function). We’ll deal with some of these things later, but for now …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to use the word <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong> to name the kind of expression to the right of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> in a function definition. A <strong><em>formula</em></strong> is a specific kind of algorithm generally written in traditional math notation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Algorithms, including the ones that are formulas, are written in terms of a set of <strong><em>symbols</em></strong> that stand for inputs. For instance, in <span class="math inline">\(mx + b\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the names we give to the quantities being used in the calculation.</p>
<p>The notation we are using for function definition lists some of these names in two places, and others in only one place. Again, look at <span class="math display">\[g(x) \equiv m x + b\]</span>
The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> appears both in the algorithm and the list of input name <span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span> to the left of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are different; they appear <strong>only</strong> in the algorithm. The word for such quantities in mathematics is <strong><em>parameter</em></strong>. Eventually, when the algorithm is followed, we’re going to have to put in specific numerical values in place of each parameter. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="570" href="#570"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 570" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">570</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Where will these parameter values come from?</strong> This is a subject on which mathematical notation is silent. You have to figure it out from context and experience. This is potentially very confusing, especially when a human is not around to sort things out.</p>
</div>
<div id="computer-notation" class="section level2" number="5.5">

<span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Computer notation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computer-notation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The notation used in computer programming lets us be explicit about which symbols refer to function inputs and which to parameters of the function.
Depending on the computer language things can be handled in one way or another. (For experienced computer programmers: This is the issue of <strong><em>scope</em></strong> and can be complex in its own right.) <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="580" href="#580"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 580" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">580</span></span></p>
<p>In the software used in CalcZ (R/<code>mosaic</code>, which is the R language augmented with the <code>mosaic</code> package of extensions), we will take a simple-to-use approach. It works like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All modeling functions we construct with R/<code>mosaic</code> will list parameters formally as <strong><em>arguments</em></strong> to the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is as if we wrote in traditional notation <span class="math display">\[g(x, m, b) \equiv m x + b\]</span></p>
<p>There is also a way to give default numerical values to parameters so that you can write <span class="math inline">\(g(3.5)\)</span> and the computer will know where to find the parameter values. In writing about formulas using math notation, we’ll extend the traditional notation to write, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(g(x, m=2, b=3) \equiv m x + b\)</span>.</p>
<p>In R/<code>mosaic</code>, we would construct a mathematical function like <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> using the <code>makeFun()</code> function:</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> CalcZ naming conventions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#calcz-naming-conventions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We’re going to be using and creating a lot of functions in CalcZ. Some of these functions already have <strong><em>proper names</em></strong>, usually written using short sequences of letters: for instance the pattern-book functions <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ln()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\exp()\)</span>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="600" href="#600"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 600" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">600</span></span></p>
<p>Other functions will be needed just for a sentence or a paragraph or a section, perhaps being used in an example or to lay out the steps of an algorithm. In <strong><em>natural languages</em></strong> such as English, we often use <strong><em>pronouns</em></strong> for such purposes: she, he, it, they, we, I, …. We also will use pronouns for identifying functions. Our policy is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pronoun for a function will be usually named <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> or the corresponding upper-case letters <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G()\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(H()\)</span>. <strong>The particular choice of letter f, g, or h has no significance whatsoever.</strong> It is just a way to give an unambiguous handle for a function that we are going to be using for a little while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On occasion, we will use subscripts or superscripts on these pronoun letters, for instance <span class="math inline">\(f_1()\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g^\star()\)</span>. This is a way to give us many more possible pronouns when we need them. Perhaps this is analogous to words like “sister,” “parent,” “husband,” “cousin,” etc. that allow us to refer, without a proper name, to a specific person.</p>
<p>On other occasions, where a function relates to a specific quantity such as position or velocity, we will use the names <span class="math inline">\(x()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w()\)</span>, and such. These letters are, of course, the same ones we frequently use to name the inputs to functions. How do you know whether the letter is meant to refer to an input rather than a function? The parentheses provide the clue: <span class="math inline">\(x()\)</span> is a function name, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an input name. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="610" href="#610"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 610" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">610</span></span></p>
<p>It can become tedious to give a name to every function, even if it’s not being used again. Consider this sentence as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The functions <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv \sqrt{\strut x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h(x) \equiv x^3\)</span> are examples of power-law functions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long and awkward. So we’ll feel free to write instead,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\strut x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span> are examples of power-law functions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without the formality provided by “<span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv\)</span>” it can be hard to know whether <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\strut x}\)</span> means “the square-root function” or "take the square root of a specific number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The convention we will use is based on the name used in the expression. When standard argument names from the end of the alphabet are being used without any subscript (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>) or with a special symbol as a subscript (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(t^\star\)</span>), we intend the expression to be a function. However, when we want to <strong><em>apply a function</em></strong> to specific values for inputs we will write in any of the following styles:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x^\star) \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \sqrt{\strut x^\star}\ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \sqrt{\strut x=3}\ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \left.\sqrt{\strut x}\right|_{x=3}\ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \left.g(x)\strut \right|_{x=3}\]</span></p>
<p>One of the important techniques of calculus is to take something we often think of as a number and turn it into a function whose output is a number. It will take you time to get used to the calculus notation and to be able to tell at a glance whether something is a function or a number. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="620" href="#620"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 620" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">620</span></span></p>
<p>Here’s an illustration that will only make sense to those who have already studied some calculus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_0^3\!\! f(t) dt\ \ \text{is a number, but }\int_0^x\!\! f(t) dt \ \ \text{is a function.}\ \ \]</span></p>
<p>In high-school math notation, it can be hard to tell if an expression is intended to be a function or a number. Careful attention to the CalcZ conventions will make it much easier to figure whether an expression resolves to a function or a number. When you first read a mathematical expression, a good first question to ask is, “What kind of thing is this? A function? A number?”</p>
<div class="takenote">
<p>It is essential that you can apply these conventions reflexively. Being able to say what kind of thing a symbol stands for is a key to understanding what a mathematical expression means.</p>

</span></summary><p>Use the CalcZ naming conventions to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> What is <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span>?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The name of a function<span class="mcanswer"> Correct. Right. Typically we use <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> or something similarly generic to stand for a function that we’re going to be working with for a little while. Think of these as pronouns. Just as we can say, meaningfully, “She gave it to him,” we can say <span class="math inline">\(h(x) \equiv f(x) + g(2*x)\)</span> </span><br>
</li>
<li>The name of an input.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Sorry, these will usually be letters like <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. </span><br>
</li>
<li>A specific numerical value<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Sorry, but we’ll use constructions with a subscript like <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y_\star\)</span> and the like for these. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> How come we write <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> for the name of a function rather than just <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>No good reason<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ We certainly intend with the empty parentheses to remind the reader that a name refers to a function. If you spot a place where we violate this intention, point it out to us. </span><br>
</li>
<li>It’s a reminder that we’re talking about a function with the name “<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.”<span class="mcanswer"> Right! </span><br>
</li>
<li>The parentheses are part of the name.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Not at all. Names in R never contain parentheses. So <code>f</code>, <code>fbar</code>, <code>fred</code> are all valid names in an R command, but <code>f()</code> is not. We use the parentheses when writing to a human audience as a reminder that the name is referring to a function. The computer doesn’t need any such reminders </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> What sort of thing is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y_\star\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y_{max}\)</span>?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>A particular numerical value<span class="mcanswer"> Excellent! Right. For instance, it might be the particular value for the input to a function which produces an output of zero. Or it might be a particular location in the domain of a function. </span><br>
</li>
<li>The name of an input<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Sorry. We won’t typically use subscripts when referring to an input name. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> Which of these symbols might stand for the entire <strong>domain</strong> of a function?</p>
<p>    <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span><span class="mcanswer"> Good. Right. Another term to use for a symbol standing for a domain is “name of an input.” </span>       <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ No, this is how we write the name of the function called “<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>” </span>       <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ No. <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> might be used to stand for a single point in the domain. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question E</strong> Suppose you come across <span class="math inline">\(v(w) \equiv w + 3\)</span> in this book. What do <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> stand for?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(v()\)</span> is the name of a function and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the name of the input to that function.<span class="mcanswer"> Right! Right. Whenever we write something like “name(another_name) <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>,” we’re saying <strong>explicitly</strong> that “name” refers to a function and “another_name” refers to an input. </span><br>
</li>
<li>It’s meaningless.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ We’ll try not to write meaningless mathematical expressions. If we do by mistake, let us know. </span><br>
</li>
<li>It’s the same thing as <span class="math inline">\(v = w + 3\)</span>.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ <span class="math inline">\(v = w+3\)</span> is an <strong>equation</strong>. But <span class="math inline">\(v(w) \equiv w+3\)</span> is the format for <strong>defining a function</strong> named <span class="math inline">\(v()\)</span>. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question F</strong> Are <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h(w) \equiv w^2\)</span> the same function?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Yes, although that function is being given two different names.<span class="mcanswer"> Excellent! The only thing that’s significant about the name of an input is that it be used consistently in the function algorithm. </span><br>
</li>
<li>Of course not!<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Sorry. I suppose you might ask, “What do you mean by the <strong>same</strong> function?” Remember that a function is a relationship between inputs and the output. <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h(w) \equiv w^2\)</span> describe exactly the same relationship: the output will be the square of the input. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question G</strong> Which of these is the R/mosaic notation for <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>?</p>
<p>    <code>&lt;- makeFun()</code><span class="mcanswer"> Good. </span>       <code>makeFun()</code><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Almost right. <code>makeFun()</code> creates a function but doesn’t give it a name. </span>       <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Sorry. In R, this symbol means “give a name to” whatever is on the right side of the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code>. The name being given is on the left side of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code>. </span></p>

</h2>
<p>Any name in the R language can refer to any sort of object. We will use the CalcZ naming conventions in our use of R, so that the ability you develop to read math notation should help reading R <strong>and vice versa</strong>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="630" href="#630"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 630" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">630</span></span></p>
<p>R/mosaic provides additional clues to distinguish between numbers and functions.</p>
<p>Almost all the time we will create a function using <code>makeFun()</code>. So when you see an R expression starting as <code>name &lt;- makeFun(</code>tilde expression<code>)</code> you know for sure the name refers to a function.</p>
<p>As we get deeper into calculus, you will meet additional R operators that generate functions. We’ll introduce these in good time, but for someone reviewing the course, these include <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code>, <code>antiD()</code>, <code>compose()</code> and <code>iterate()</code>.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>Some readers may have encountered R previously in a statistics or data science course. Those readers will be wondering what is the purpose of <code>makeFun()</code>. Experienced programmers know that the way you make functions in R is by using the <code>function</code> keyword. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">f</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">function</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span> <span class="fl">3</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s a completely correct and legitimate way to define a function in R and in most settings is the universal practice.</p>
<p>We developed <code>makeFun()</code> to handle a situation where computers, in their insistence on avoiding ambiguity, will do something that is not what the person familiar with math notation is likely to suspect. The problem comes up in something as simple as</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">g</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">function</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span> <span class="va">m</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="va">b</span> <span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In traditional math notation, <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv m x + b\)</span>, we are usually silent on where parameters like <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are coming from. And, to be honest, you don’t have to worry about this <strong>until you try to evaluate the function</strong>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="630" href="#630"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 630" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">630</span></span></p>
<p>If you evaluate, say, the command <span class="math inline">\(g(3)\)</span>, the R system knows how to find the right values for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. If there are no such objects in the appropriate places in the R system, an error message will be generated. The rules that computer languages follow in tracking down symbols that aren’t in the argument list are called <strong><em>scoping rules</em></strong>. Scoping is an advanced programming concept and different languages use different rules.</p>
<p>For those few whose programming background includes an understanding of scoping here’s an explanation. The ordinary scoping rules in R would make undefined parameters like <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in a function definition have bindings in the environment in which the function was defined. This would typically be the global environment, an unsatisfactory arrangement it would be difficult to customize an individual function or invocation of a function to use a specific value for the parameters. <code>makeFun()</code> is arranged to add any parameters in the function algorithm to the argument list. The <code>makeFun()</code> command creates a function with 3 arguments.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">makeFun</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">m</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="va">b</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## function (x, m, b) 
## m * x + b</code></pre>
<p>The point of the <code>~ x</code> part of the tilde expression is simply to name which arguments should come first. To evaluate the function, you’ll have to provide values for <code>m</code> and <code>b</code>. But some operations on a function—differentiation and anti-differentiation, in particular—can be done without having to specify parameter values. For those of you who know what differentiation or anti-differentiation are, here is an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">m</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="va">b</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## function (x, m, b) 
## m</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">antiD</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">m</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="va">b</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## function (x, C = 0, m, b) 
## m * 1/2 * x^2 + b * x + C</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you have particular numerical values in mind for the parameters. For instance, if you are modeling the trajectory of a ball, you will undoubtedly need to make use of gravitational acceleration at the Earth’s surface, which is <span class="math inline">\(9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2\)</span>. You might prefer not to include the specific number 9.8 in your function definitions so that you can use the same functions to model a ball’s trajectory on Mars. But since most balls are thrown on Earth, maybe it’s not worthwhile to insist that the value 9.8 be specified every time the function is used. You can have it both ways by using <code>g</code> as the parameter name and instruct R to set <code>g</code> to 9.8 <em>unless otherwise specified</em>. The function will look like this: <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="640" href="#640"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 640" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">640</span></span></p>

</h2>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> sign carries a lot of weight in high-school notation. Too much weight. It is used for several meanings that ought to be distinguished one from another. Combining them all into one symbol leads to confusion and error.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning 1</strong>: “Is defined to be …”</p>
<p>We use <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> in mathematical notation and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code> in R. The notation in R is a bit simpler than the mathematical notation: it is a way of giving something a name.</p>

<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">name</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">something</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If the “something” is a function, you will see that on the left side of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code>, for instance by use of the <code>makeFun()</code> operator in <code>h &lt;- makeFun(x^2 ~ x)</code>. The left side is simply a name.</p>
<p>In math notation, the equivalent would be written <span class="math inline">\(h(x) \equiv x^2\)</span>. The left side isn’t exactly a name. It’s a name followed by parentheses in which are the names being used in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in writing about functions, we will generally provide a hint that the name refers to the function, writing <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> or <code>h()</code>. The parentheses aren’t part of the name; the name here is <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. But the parentheses remind us that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a function. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="650" href="#650"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 650" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">650</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Meaning 2</strong>: “Happens to be …”</p>
<p>The acceleration due to gravity is often given the name <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. On Earth’s surface, it happens to be <span class="math inline">\(9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2\)</span>. In our math notation, we will use the equal sign for this narrow meaning, as in <span class="math inline">\(g=9.8\text{m}/\text{s}^2\)</span>. In R we will use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">=</a></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning 3</strong>: “Gets closer and closer to …”</p>
<p>Calculus is about relationships: the connection between two (or more) things. So you will hear phrases like, “As <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> increases, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> decreases.” Or, in everyday experience, “As it gets more humid, the weather becomes more uncomfortable.” Or, “slower is safer,” or “the spicier the better” or “the heavier the blanket, the warmer I’ll be.” (One of the important uses of <strong><em>derivatives</em></strong> in calculus is to represent such statements quantitatively. But that’s a subject for the next Block.)</p>
<p>In calculus, sometimes you have to distinguish between “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is zero” and “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> gets closer and closer to zero.” We’ll need this when we want to say, “It gets smaller and smaller, but doesn’t disappear entirely.” The symbol for “gets closer and closer to” is <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>, as in <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow 0\)</span></p>
<div class="takenote">
<p>In reading math, take care to notice which of <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> is being used. The sign has something important to say and is intended to help you make sense of what you read.</p>

</span></summary><p>According to the notation style we use in CalcZ, which of these things is a function? Which a number?</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> What kind of a thing is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{z}\)</span>?</p>
<p>    A function<span class="mcanswer"> Good. </span>       A number<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is one of the standard names we will use for an input to a function. If we had given the function a name, for instance <span class="math inline">\(g(z) \equiv \sqrt{z}\)</span>, we would be able to tell from the <span class="math inline">\((z)\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> is a function. But whenever we use a standard input name, the expression is a function. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> What kind of a thing is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{y^\star}\)</span>?</p>
<p>    A function<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ According to our convention, the name <span class="math inline">\(y^\star\)</span> refers to a particular value as opposed to the name of a function input. </span>       A number<span class="mcanswer"> Correct. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> What kind of a thing is <span class="math inline">\(e^{k t}\)</span>?</p>
<p>    A function<span class="mcanswer"> Right-oh! </span>       A number<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ The letter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is one of our standard letters for input names. <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a letter, but since it is not from the end of the alphabet, you have a hint that it is intended to be a parameter, that is a symbol representing a specific numerical quantity. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> What kind of a thing is <span class="math inline">\(g(k) \equiv e^k\)</span>?</p>
    A function<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Notwithstanding our convention that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is not on its own a name used for inputs, when we use the full function-definition style, anything in the parentheses following the function name is explicitly stated as an input name. </span>       A number<span class="mcanswer"> Right-oh! </span>

</span></summary><p>The following traditional-style notation is intended to define a function that is 2 times the pattern-book sinusoid. But something is wrong.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(t) \equiv 2 \sin(x)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> What’s wrong with the definition?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> isn’t an appropriate name<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ You can name functions what you like. </span><br>
</li>
<li>The formula should be written <span class="math inline">\(2 \times \sin(x)\)</span><span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ You are welcome to write things that way if you want to emphasize the multiplication, but you don’t have to. On the other hand, in R it would be absolutely required to write the multiplication operator: <code>2 * sin(x)</code>. </span><br>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is not a good choice for the input name.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ It’s a fine choice, especially when the input is time. </span><br>
</li>
<li>The input name in the formula doesn’t match the input name on the left side of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>.<span class="mcanswer"> Right! That’s it. Once you choose an input name (here, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), make sure to write the formula in terms of that name. </span>
