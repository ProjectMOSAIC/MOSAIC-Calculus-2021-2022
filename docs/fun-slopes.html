<p><em>The use of functions to model and explore continuous change</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agenda of this chapter is to give specific mathematical meaning to the word “change.”</p>
<div id="change-and-slope" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Change and slope<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#change-and-slope"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You have an solid, intuitive sense of what “change” means. In mathematics, and especially the mathematics of functions, change has a very simple meaning that you have already touched on in your previous math education.</p>
<p>The word that encapsulates “change” in high-school math is <strong><em>slope</em></strong>. For instance, you’ve undoubtedly had to calculate the slope of a straight line in a graph. You learned about “rise” and “run” and how to read them from a graph or from a formula. The slope is the ratio: rise over run.</p>
<p>Slope is a lovely <strong><em>metaphor</em></strong> for change, since everyone has a intuitive sense of the slope of a road or of a hillside. You learned to apply this intuition to reading graphs and the slope of a line. We’ll exploit the intuitive ability to read a landscape in order to introduce abstract mathematical ideas in a down-to-earth setting. It’s a very effective pedagogical strategy.</p>
<p>But not everything that changes has a “slope.” For instance, the population of a country can change, as can the number of new cases of an epidemic disease, the temperature of a cup of coffee, or the distance from Earth of a spacecraft. A major part of learning calculus is generalizing and abstracting the mathematical concept of which “slope” is an example and becoming proficient with mathematical procedures for working with change.</p>

<p>Most people are comfortable with the ideas of daily changes in temperature or monthly changes in credit-card debt or quarterly changes in the unemployment rate or annual changes in the height of a child. Such things are easy to record in, say, a spreadsheet. For example, as I write, the weather forecast for the next several days (in southeastern Colorado in mid-May) is <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1110" href="#1110"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1110" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1110</span></span></p>

<p>Such data is said to be <strong><em>discrete</em></strong>. The day is listed, but not the time of day. The high temperature is forecast, but not the time of that high. The “description” is also discrete, one of the several words that are used to summarize the quality of the weather, as opposed to the quantity of rain.</p>
<p>Calculus is about <strong><em>continuous change</em></strong>. For instance, if the weather bureau provide a web interface that let me enter the date and time to the nearest fraction of a second, they would be giving a way to track the change <strong><em>continuously</em></strong>. Many physical processes are intrinsically continuous, for instance the motion (change in position) of a spacecraft or the height of the tide or the stress on a tree as a function of wind velocity.</p>
<p>Finding a language to describe continuous change—famously, the position of the moon or planets in their orbit, or the speed of a ball rolling down a ramp—was central to the emergence of what historians call the “Age of Enlightenment” or “modern scientific method.” The first complete presentation of that language was published by Isaac Newton based on his work in the 1660s. As you might guess, the name of the language is “calculus.”</p>

<p>You already know pretty much everything there is to know about the straight-line function,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formula</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \equiv a x + b\)</span>. The parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the “slope” and “intercept” respectively. (More precisely, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the “y-intercept.” But in statistics and modeling, it’s just the “intercept.”)</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading parameters from a graph</strong>: You learned several ways to do this which are all equivalent. Maybe the easiest is the read the y-intercept off the graph. That’s <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Then choose some non-zero <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and read off from the graph the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1)\)</span>. The slope is simply <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x_1) - b}{x_0}\]</span></p>
<p>The <strong><em>y-intercept method</em></strong> is a special case of a more general method, the <strong><em>two-point method</em></strong>, that you can use even if the y-intercept isn’t shown on the graph. Pick two specific values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. Evalate the function at these input values and compute the rise over run: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{rise over run} \equiv \frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}\]</span>
The rise over run is the slope of the straight line.</p>
<p>The y-intercept method is exactly the same as the two-point method with <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = 0\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Matching a straight-line function to data</strong>: You might not have been taught this formally, but the basic process is easy to imitate. The process is called <strong><em>line fitting</em></strong> or, in statistics and other fields, <strong><em>linear regression</em></strong>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1120" href="#1120"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1120" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1120</span></span></p></li>

</h2>
<p>To illustrate line fitting, let’s return to the cooling mug of water. Figure <a href="fun-slopes.html#fig:Fun-4-a">9.1</a> shows the data along with a dozen candidate straight line functions, each one drawn in its own color.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Some of the straight-line models are a much better match to the data than others. The blue-shaded functions are pretty good fits, at least when you consider the limitations of matching data with a curved pattern by a straight line. The green-colored functions are maybe OK but not as good as the blue, and the purple-shaded functions are just horrible.</p>
<p>Now that you know what a reasonable straight-line model looks like, you will find it pretty easy to draw one on data graphics that even remotely show a straight-line pattern.</p>
<p>Step 1: Draw a reasonable straight-line through the data points.</p>
<p>Step 2: Find the parameters that correspond to the line you drew.</p>

<p>Since the slope is our standard way of representing a relationship of change, we will often use it as a way of summarizing a function. To illustrate, consider the exponential model we constructed to match the cooling-water data: <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1130" href="#1130"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1130" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1130</span></span></p>

</span></summary><p>We will be working extensively with the <em>change</em> in output value of a function when the <em>input value changes</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The change in the output value of a function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> when the input changes from <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x = b\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[f(x=b) - f(x=a)\]</span> Notice that when we talk about the change from <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> we subtract <span class="math inline">\(f(x=a)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(f(x=b)\)</span>. That change is sometimes called the <strong>rise</strong> in the value of the function. Rise always compares (by subtraction) the two <strong>output values</strong> corresponding to two specific input values. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> stand for specific numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Corresponding with the idea of the change in output being <span class="math inline">\(f(x=b) - f(x=a)\)</span> the change in the input value to a function is <span class="math inline">\(b - a\)</span>. This is often called the <em>run</em> in the value of the input.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each point on the graph of a function has Cartesian coordinates <span class="math inline">\((a, f(x=a))\)</span>. For example, the graph of the function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> shown in Graph I includes points such as <span class="math inline">\((1.0, 4.0)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((3.5, 3.0)\)</span>. The second coordinate is the output value when we provide the first coordinate as an input value. The nature of the <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> function (as defined by the graph) is such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x=1) \equiv 4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x=3.5) \equiv 3\)</span>.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-140-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> True or false: In Graph I, the <em>rise</em> from a to b is positive.</p>
<p>    TRUE<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ <span class="math inline">\(f(x=a) &gt; f(x=b)\)</span>, so the rise <span class="math inline">\(f(x=b) - f(x=a)\)</span> is <em>negative</em>. </span>       FALSE<span class="mcanswer"> Right-oh! </span></p>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> True or false: In Graph I, the <em>run</em> from <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> is positive.</p>
<p>    TRUE<span class="mcanswer"> Right! </span>       FALSE<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ The <em>run</em> is about the relative positions of <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> on the x-axis.

<p>    TRUE<span class="mcanswer"> Right-oh! </span>       FALSE<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ The <em>run</em> is about the relative positions of a and b on the x-axis. Since a is to the left of b, the run from a to b is positive. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question D</strong> True or false: In Graph II, the <em>rise</em> from a to b is positive.</p>
<p>    TRUE<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Remember, the <em>rise</em> from <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(f(x=b) - f(x=a)\)</span> </span>       FALSE<span class="mcanswer"> Good. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question E</strong> True or false: In Graph II, the <em>run</em> from b to c is positive.</p>
<p>    TRUE<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ The <em>run</em> from <span class="math inline">\(x=b\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x=c\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(c - b\)</span>.

<p><strong>Question F</strong> True or false: In Graph II, the <em>rise</em> from b to c is positive.</p>

<p><strong>Question G</strong> For an interval [2, 6] what is the value of the run? (The answer is independent of any particular graph/function.)</p>

</span></summary><p>Some years ago, you learned to calculate the slope of a straight-line function. If you had a graph, you would mark out a <strong>run</strong> and the corresponding <strong>rise</strong>, then compute rise/run. If you had a formula definition, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \equiv 3 - 4 x\)</span>, you would simply read the slope off as the <strong>coefficient</strong> on the function input. Here, the input is named <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and its coefficient in the formula is <span class="math inline">\(-4\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this question, we ask you to estimate the slope from a graph of the function. But the function is <strong>exponential</strong>, so not a straight line.</p>
<p>A fundamental idea in calculus is that even a function with a curved graph, if you zoom in closely around a given point, will look like a straight line. And you know how to calculate the slope of a straight line.</p>
<p>When the graph is curved, the slope will be different at different points along the graph. So there’s not a single slope for the function. Still, we can talk about the “slope at a point.”</p>
<p>One way to specify a point on a function’s graph is to give the horizontal coordinate: the <strong>input</strong> to the function. But here we’re going to give you the <strong>output</strong> of the function.</p>
<p>Estimate the slope of the exponential function <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv e^x\)</span> at several inputs, which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_4\)</span>. We won’t give you numerical values for the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> points, but we will tell you the output of the function at each of those inputs. the values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> where:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><span class="math inline">\(g(x_1) = 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g(x_2) = 5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g(x_3) = 10\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g(x_4) = 0.1\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The code sandbox below already contains an R command to plot out the mathematical exponential function over the domain <span class="math inline">\(-3 \leq x \leq 3\)</span>. For each of (a)-(d), modify the command to zoom in on the domain around around the appropriate value of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. Then calculate the slope of the curve at that <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve found the answer and seen how to specify the domain on a slice plot, here’s a technique that can make your work a bit easier. Add this to the command that plots <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span> on the domain <span class="math inline">\(-3 \leq x \leq 3\)</span></p>
<pre><code>%&gt;% plotly::ggplotly()</code></pre>
Make sure the <code>%&gt;%</code> is on the <em>same line</em> as the <code>slice_plot()</code> expression itself. Run the amended command then hover the cursor over the graph.

<p>“Slope” is a natural metaphor when thinking of a function as a graph. But a more general way to describe the concept is the <strong><em>rate of change</em></strong> of the output with respect to the input. The change in the output from one end of the interval is <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1) - f(x_0)\)</span>, the change in the input is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0\)</span>. If the input is time (in hours), and the output is the position of a car (in miles), then the rate of change is <em>miles-per-hour</em>: the car’s velocity.</p>
<p>For a straight-line function—think of a car driving at constant speed on a highway—it doesn’t matter what you choose for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> (so long as they are not identical). But for other functions, the choice does matter.</p>
<p>Imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}. Over the course of an hour, the car travelled about 25 miles. In other words, the <strong><em>average</em></strong> speed is 25 miles/hour: the <em>slope</em> of the red line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car was stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D) and sometimes much faster than average (time B).</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/stop-and-go-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>During the interval from B to C, the car was travelling relatively fast. The slope of the brown segment connecting the position at times B and C is the <strong><em>average</em></strong> rate of change between times B and C. It’s easy to see that the average rate of change from B to C is larger than the overall average from <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span>. Calculating that slope is a matter of evaluating the position at the endpoints and dividing by the length of the interval. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1140" href="#1140"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1140" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1140</span></span></p>

</div>
<p>You are writing a business plan for a proposed pine forest. Among other things, you have to forecast the revenue that will be generated and when you will have salable product.</p>
<p>They say that “time is money.” Every year you wait before harvest is another year that you don’t have the money. On the other hand, every year that you wait means more wood at the end. How to decide when to harvest?</p>
<p>The tree continues to grow until year 50, when it seems to have reached an equilibrium: perhaps growth goes to zero, or rot balances what growth there is. There’s no point waiting until after year 50.</p>
<p>At year 25, the tree is growing as fast as it ever will. You’ll get about 600 board-feet of lumber. Should you harvest at year 25? No! That the tree is growing so fast means that you will have a lot more wood at year 26, 27, and so on. The time to harvest is when the growth is getting smaller, so that it’s not worth waiting an extra year.</p>
<p>The quantity of interest is the average rate of growth from seedling to harvest. Harvesting at year 25 will give a total change of 600 board feet over 25 years, giving an average rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(600 \div 25 = 24 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}\)</span>. But if you wait until year 35, you’ll have about 900 board feet, giving an average rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(900 \div 35 = 25.7 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to construct a diagram that shows whether year 35 is best for the harvest. Recall that our fundamental model of change is the straight-line function. So we’re going to <strong><em>model the model</em></strong> of tree growth as a straight line function. Like the more realistic model, our straight-line model will start out with zero wood at the time of planting. And to be faithful to the realistic model, we’ll insist that the straight-line intersect or touch the realistic model at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="fun-slopes.html#fig:aver-tree2">9.4</a> reiterates the realistic model of the tree but adds on to it several straight-line models that all give zero harvestable wood at planting time. Each of the green lines captures a scenario where the tree is harvested at the indicated time: <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>, and so on. For the perspective of representing the rate of growth per year from planting to harvest, the straight-line green models do not need to replicate the actual growth curve. The complexities of the curve are not relevant to the growth rate, which can be simplified down to a straight-line model connecting the output at planting time to the output at harvest time. In contrast, the red curves are not suitable models because they don’t match the situation at any harvest time; they don’t touch the curve anywhere after planting!</p>

<p>To maximize average lumber volume per year, choose a harvest time that produces the steepest possible green segment. From Figure <a href="fun-slopes.html#fig:aver-tree2">9.4</a> you can see that it’s possible to do a little better by harvesting before year 35 (shown as <span class="math inline">\(t_3\)</span> in the diagram).</p>
<p>It’s often best to create a function that shows explicitly what one is trying to optimize. Here that’s ave_growth(year) <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> volume(year)/year and is plotted in Figure <a href="#fig:aver-tree3"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>average rate of change</em></strong> is the slope of a line segment connecting two points on the graph of a function, the points <span class="math inline">\(\left(\strut t_0, f(t_0)\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left(\strut t_1, f(t_1)\right)\)</span>. It reflects all the point-to-point changes in the value of the function over the interval <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> in the function’s domain.</p>
<p>It turns out to be helpful to consider the rate of change of a function at an individual point <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> in the domain, rather than the interval between two points. This rate of change <em>at a point</em> is called the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong>.
In Block 2, we’ll see that a good way to define an instantaneous rate of change at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> is as the average rate of change over the interval <span class="math inline">\(t_0 \leq t \leq t_0 + h\)</span> with the proviso that the interval length <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> goes as closely as it can to zero. Visually, this is the line that’s tangent to the function’s graph at the input value <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> as in Figure <a href="fun-slopes.html#fig:tangent-line-exp">9.5</a>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1150" href="#1150"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1150" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1150</span></span></p>

<p>It’s convenient to be able to find the slope of such a tangent line using just the definition <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, rather than having to draw a graph and eyeball the tangent. For now, let’s approximate the slope of tangent line by the average rate of change over a small run from <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_0 + 0.1\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\text{slope of}\ f(t) \ \text{at}\ t_0 \approx\frac{f(t_0 + 0.1) - f(t_0)}{0.1} = \frac{\text{amount of rise}}{\text{length of run}}\]</span>
The <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> symbol means “is approximately.” For now, I want to put off the question of what “approximately” means. In modeling, whether the 0.1 gives a good enough approximation will depend on the function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> and the context in which the slope is needed. For instance, in drawing Figure <a href="fun-slopes.html#fig:tangent-line-exp">9.5</a> I needed to find the tangent line. Using 0.1 is entirely satisfactory in this setting but it might not be in other settings.</p>
<p>The notation “slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t=t_0\)</span>” is long-winded and awkward. If we were looking at the “value of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> we have at hand a much more concise notation: <span class="math inline">\(f(t_0)\)</span>. But it doesn’t work to write”slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(t_0)\)</span>" because <span class="math inline">\(f(t_0)\)</span> is a <strong>quantity</strong> and not a <strong>function</strong>. Instead, let’s make a concise notation for “slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>.” Following tradition, we’ll write <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}f(t)\)</span>. The name of this “slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>” function is <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}f()\)</span>: a two-letter name. When we want to say, “the (approximate) slope of the tangent line to <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, we can write simply: <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}f(t_0)\]</span>
meaning, evaluate the”slope function of f()" at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>To formalize this, we’ll define the <strong><em>slope function of f()</em></strong> as
<span class="math display">\[{\cal D}f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t + 0.1) - f(t)}{0.1}\]</span>
Let’s look at the slope functions that correspond to some of pattern-book functions: <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span>. We can define them easily enough in R:</p>

<div class="why">
<p>Why did you plot both the function and the slope function in the same graphics frame? <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1160" href="#1160"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1160" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1160</span></span></p>
<p>Excellent question! In general, it is illegitimate to plot a function and it’s slope function on the same vertical axis. The reason is the units of the two functions will be different. For instance, the output of a function position(t) might have units of “miles,” while the output of the slope function of position (that is, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span>position(t) would have units such as miles-per-hour.) So, as a general rule, never plot a function and its corresponding slope function on the same scale.</p>
<p>An exception is for the pattern-book functions. These always take a number as input and produce a number as output. The slope function of a pattern-book function also produces a number as output.</p>
<p>This exception is not a good excuse for indulging a bad practice. Perhaps you’ll forgive me if I point out that I wanted to emphasize the point by demonstrating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="takenote">
<p>Here, I’m writing the slope function of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}f(t)\)</span>. That works for this chapter, which deals with functions of only one variable. But in general modeling functions have more than one variable, for instance <span class="math inline">\(g(x, t)\)</span>. To work with slope functions with more than one variable, we need to extend the notation a little. We will place a small subscript after <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span> to indicate which variable we are changing. Thus, there will be two slope functions for <span class="math inline">\(g(x,t)\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\require{color}{\cal D}_{\color{blue}x} g(x, t) \equiv \frac{g({\color{blue}x + 0.1}, t) - g(x, t)}{0.1}\\
\text{and}\\
{\cal D}_{\color{red}t} g(x, t) \equiv \frac{g(x, {\color{red}t + 0.1}) - g(x, t)}{0.1}\]</span>

<div class="intheworld">
<p>In the previous section we looked at the optimal time to harvest a tree so that the average rate of growth in usable lumber over the tree’s life is maximized. Using a model of tree growth of a ponderosa pine we found the best harvest time to be 32 years.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the modeling phase of the wood-harvest problem with a new perspective. The real objective of tree farming is to maximize the <strong>economic value</strong> of the wood. This depends on the market price of the wood which itself may be changing in time. A market-savvy modeler will want to exploit any information about the possibility of rising or falling prices in selecting the best harvest time. Companies often hire economists to forecast market trends, but this requires a deep knowledge of trends in supply and demand which is out of the scope of what we can cover in this book.</p>
<p>However, there is one economic principle that we can incorporate into the model without such detailed, industry specific expertise. This is the economic principle of <strong><em>opportunity cost</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Opportunity cost takes into account when valuing an asset the other possible uses of that asset. For example, lumber companies constantly invest in planting new trees for future harvest. In order to do this, they borrow money and they pay interest on the borrowed money. They need to borrow because their existing assets are tied up in the form of wood. The opportunity cost of not harvesting a tree is the interest on the loan the company needs to take out in order to invest for the future.</p>
<p>Between year 30 and 32, there is hardly any change in the value of the average-rate-of-change function. It’s increasing a little, but is it really worthwhile to wait? One argument is that at year 30 you already have a valuable resource: wood that could be money in the bank. If the money were in the bank, you could invest it and earn more money <em>and</em> at the same time get a new seedling in the ground to start its growth. You’re doing two things at once. Efficient!</p>
<p>To know what is the best year for harvest from this point of view, you want to calculate the effective “interest rate” on the present amount of wood that you earn in the form of new wood. That interest rate is the ratio of the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of growth of new wood divided by the amount of existing wood. Figure @ref{fig:tree-interest} shows this function.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:tree-interest"></span>
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/tree-interest-1.png" alt="The instantaneous investment return from the tree is the instantaneous rate of change in wood volume divided by the wood volume itself. This falls over the age of the tree as the harvestable wood volume increases." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 9.7: The instantaneous investment return from the tree is the instantaneous rate of change in wood volume divided by the wood volume itself. This falls over the age of the tree as the harvestable wood volume increases.
</p>
</div>
<p>Early in the tree’s life, the growth is high compared to the volume of the tree. That’s because the tree is small. As the years pass, the tree gets bigger. Even though the rate of growth increases through year 23, the accumulated volume increases even faster, so there is a fall in the rate of return.</p>
<p>The best time to harvest is when the annual “interest rate” paid by the growing tree falls to the level of the next best available investment. Suppose that investment would pay 10% per year. Then harvest the tree when the function values falls below 10%. That happens at year 24. If the next best investment paid only 5% (blue horizontal line), the harvest should be made at about year 29. If money could be borrowed at 2%, it would be worthwhile to harvest the tree still later.</p>
