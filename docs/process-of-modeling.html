<p>Seen very abstractly, a mathematical model is a set of <strong><em>functions</em></strong> that represent the relationships between inputs and outputs. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="900" href="#900"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 900" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">900</span></span></p>
<p>At the most simple level, building a model can be a short process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Develop an understanding of the relationship you want to model. Often, part of this “understanding” is the pattern seen in data.</li>
<li>Choose a function type—e.g. exponential, sinusoidal, sigmoid—that you think would be a good match to the relationship.</li>
<li>Find parameters that scales your function to be able to accept real-world inputs and generate real-world outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to distinguish between two basic types of model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Empirical models</em></strong> which are rooted in <strong><em>observation</em></strong> and <strong><em>data</em></strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Mechanistic models</em></strong> such as those created by applying fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to put off mechanistic models for a while, for two reasons. First, the “fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such” are often expressed with the concepts and methods of calculus. We are heading there, but at this point you don’t yet know the core concepts and methods of calculus. Second, most students don’t make a careful study of the “fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such” until <em>after</em> they have studied calculus. So examples of mechanistic models will be a bit hollow at this point.</p>
<p>We’ll start then with empirical modeling: finding functions that are a good summary of data. The process of constructing a model that is a good match for data is called <strong><em>curve fitting</em></strong>, or, more generally, <strong><em>fitting a model</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A good place to start building a model is to pick one of the basic modeling functions. This works surprisingly often. To remind you, here are our nine <strong><em>pattern-book</em></strong> functions: <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="910" href="#910"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 910" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">910</span></span></p>

<p>The basic modeling functions are the same, but replace the plain <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the pattern-book function with a straight-line function, for instance <span class="math inline">\(ax + b\)</span> or, equivalently <span class="math inline">\(a(x - x_0)\)</span>.

<p>It helps in making the selection to have ready to mind the basic shape of each of these function families. To review, revisit Section <a href="pattern-book.html#function-shapes">2.4</a>.</p>
<p>Remember also that, in general, we scale the inputs and scale the output. This means that in choose a model family, we don’t have to worry at first about the numbers on the axes. (Of course, those numbers will be critically important later on in the process!) The scaling does, however, allow us to consider some variations on the shapes of the modeling functions. In particular, the <strong><em>input scaling</em></strong> lets us flip the shape right-for-left. And the <strong><em>output scaling</em></strong> lets us flip the shape top-for-bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, basic shape</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f(-t)\)</span>, flipped right-for-left</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(-f(t)\)</span>, flipped top-for-bottom</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(-f(-t)\)</span>, flipped both top-for-bottom and right-for-left</li>
</ul>
<p>For functions such as the sinusoid, flipping is not much use, since the flipped sinusoid curve is still a sinusoid, although with a shifted input. Similarly, a right-for-left flipped gaussian function has the same shape as the original. For the straight-line function, flipping of either sort accomplishes the same thing: changing the sign of the slope.</p>
<p>For the exponential function, the two possible types of flipping—right-for-left and top-for-bottom—produce four different curves, all of which are exponential, shown in Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:four-variations">8.1</a>.</p>

<p>Your task is to modify the values of <code>d</code> and <code>k</code> such that all three curves lie on top of one another. (Leave <code>h</code> at the value 4.) You can find the appropriate values of <code>d</code> and <code>k</code> to accomplish this by any means you like, say, by using the algebra of exponents or by using trial and error. (Trial and error is a perfectly valid strategy regardless of what your high-school math teachers might have said about “guess and check.” The trick is to make each new guess systematically based on your previous ones and observation of how those previous ones performed.)</p>

<p>The exponential function is particularly useful when the quantity we want to model shows <strong><em>constant proportional increase</em></strong>. Many quantities in everyday life are this way. For instance, an increase in salary is typically presented in a format like “a 3% increase.” The population growth of a country is often presented as “percent per year.” Inflation in the price of goods is similarly described in percent per year. Interest on money in a bank savings account is also described as percent per year. But if you have the bad fortune to owe money to a loan shark, the proportional increase might be described as “percent per month” or “percent per week.” <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="920" href="#920"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 920" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">920</span></span></p>
<p>When you know the “percent increase per time” of a quantity whose initial value is <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the exponential function is easy to write down: <span class="math display">\[f(t) = A (1+r)^t\]</span>
The number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is often called the <strong><em>interest rate</em></strong> or <strong><em>discount rate</em></strong> and is given in <strong>percent</strong>.</p>
<div class="takenote">
<p>Regrettably, it’s extremely easy amd common to forget the rules for addition with percent. If <span class="math inline">\(r = 5\%\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((1+r) = 1.05\)</span>, not 6. Always keep in mind that <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{100}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another source of error stems from the tradition in mathematics of using the number <span class="math inline">\(e=2.718282\)</span> as the “natural” base of the exponential function, whereas in <span class="math inline">\(f(t) = A (1+r)^t\)</span> the base is <span class="math inline">\(1+r\)</span>.</p>
<p>You can translate an exponential <span class="math inline">\(b^t\)</span> in any base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to the “natural” base. This is just a matter of calculating the appropriate parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(e^k = b\)</span>. Using logarithms, <span class="math display">\[e^k = b\ \ \implies \ \  k=\ln(b)\]</span> For instance, if
<span class="math inline">\(r=5\%\)</span> per year, we’ll have <span class="math inline">\(k = \ln(1+r) = \ln(1.05) = 0.488\)</span> per year.</p>
<p>Almost everybody is happier doing arithmetic with numbers like 2 and 10 rather than <span class="math inline">\(e=2.718282\)</span>. For this reason, you may see formulations of the exponential function as <span class="math inline">\(g(t) \equiv 2^{a t}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(h(t) \equiv 10^{c t}\)</span>. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(2^{a t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e^{at}\)</span>, although both exponential functions, are quantitatively different. If you want to write <span class="math inline">\(2^{at}\)</span> using the “natural” base, it will be <span class="math inline">\(e^{\ln(2) a\, t }\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(10^{ct} = e^{\ln(10) c\, t}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Exponential functions also describe <strong><em>decrease</em></strong> or <strong><em>decay</em></strong>. Just replace <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(-t\)</span>. That is, a movie of a decreasing quantity is just the movie of an increasing quantity played backwards in time! <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="930" href="#930"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 930" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">930</span></span></p>

</div>
<p>Our task is to translate this data into the form of a function that takes time as input and returns temperature as output. Such a model would be useful for, say, filling in the gaps of the data. For instance, we might want to find the temperature of the water immediately after being poured from the kettle into the mug.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, one sees that the temperature decreases along a curve: cooling fast at first and then more slowly. This is the pattern of the flipped right-for-left exponential. (Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:four-variations">8.1</a>(B)) We can imagine then that an exponential, <span class="math inline">\(A e^{kt} + C\)</span> will be a suitable model form for the cooling water.</p>
<p>What remains is to find the parameters <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Here is a general process for curve-fitting an exponential. Later, we’ll apply this process specifically to the water-cooling situation.</p>
<p><strong>General process for curve-fitting an exponential</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to find the parameters <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in the formula <span class="math inline">\(A e^{kx} + C\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 0</strong>: Check that the data show an exponential pattern in one of its varieties, namely a smooth increase or decrease and leveling out beyond some value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. If this isn’t true, reconsider whether you should be using an exponential function in the first place. Using your mind’s eye (or paper, if you like) sketch out an exponential-shaped curve that follows the overall trend of the data. We’ll call this imagined curve <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Find the <strong><em>baseline</em></strong>. This is the output level at which the function has a horizontal asymptote, that is, at which the function levels off. <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is this baseline level.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Find the numerical value of the imagined function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> at input <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. We’ll call this value <span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(A \equiv f(0) - C\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Estimate parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> using these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Pick any input value, which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_2)\)</span> is far from the baseline.</li>
<li>Find an input value, which we’ll call <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1)\)</span> is halfway between the baseline <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x_2)\)</span>, that is, <span class="math display">\[f(x_1) = \frac{f(x_2) - C}{2}\]</span>
</li>
<li>Then <span class="math display">\[k = \frac{\ln(2)}{x_2 - x_1} \approx \frac{0.693}{x_2 - x_1}\]</span>
</li>
<li>Using this simple test to double-check your work. If the horizontal asymptote of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> (that is, approach to the baseline) is for <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> should be <strong>negative</strong>. If the horizontal asymptote is for <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow - \infty\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will be positive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the question of “growth or decay” depends only on the sign of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. You can have an exponentially decaying process that’s increasing. Consider, for instance, the speed of a car as it merges onto a highway from a slow speed on the entrance ramp. The car’s velocity is increasing, but as you approach highway speed the rate of increase gets smaller. That’s exponential <strong>decay</strong>.</p>
<p>The procedure in Step 3 works for estimating <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stemps from a very important property of exponential functions: Exponential functions always double/half at a constant pace. By design, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
directly determines that pace. Picking an <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> and finding the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> gives the length of the input interval, <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_2\)</span> over which the distance from the baseline doubles/halves.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable about the doubling/halving time is that, for a genuinely exponential function, it doesn’t matter which point we choose for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. In practice working with graphed data, it’s best to choose so that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1)\)</span> is discernibly far from the baseline. started with, this property is true across the entire input domain.
The <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\ln(2)\)</span> corresponds to idea of doubling/halving. The logarithm converts <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to an scale that will generate 2 when exponentiated.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> If you can plot the data, do so. Add to that a graphics layer showing the function <span class="math inline">\(A e^{k x} + C\)</span> using the values for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that you just found. If you are not satisfied with the way the plotted function approximates the data, tweak the parameters a bit until you are.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential curve fitting applied to the water-cooling data</strong></p>
<p>Let’s illustrate the general process on the water-cooling data, redrawn in Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:Fun-4-a-2-1">8.3</a>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="950" href="#950"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 950" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">950</span></span></p>

Figure 8.3: The cooling-water data, repeated here for convenience.
</p>
</div>
<p>Step 0: The data indicate a smooth curve. As <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> gets large, the curve approaches a constant. So an exponential model is reasonable.</p>
<p>Step 1: The curve looks like it’s leveling out at a temperature of about 25 degrees C for large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(A \approx 25^{\circ} \text{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The point far from the baseline is located at <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 15 \text{sec}\)</span> with a value <span class="math inline">\({\cal D} \approx 80^\circ\text{C}\)</span>.</li>
<li>This if <span class="math inline">\(55^\circ\text{C}\)</span> from the baseline. We want to find the value of <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> where the temperature will be half way from 80 to the baseline. That’s a temperature of about <span class="math inline">\(80 - 55/2 = 53.5\)</span>. Scanning over to the right, the function that I can imagine going through the data crossed <span class="math inline">\(53^\circ\)</span> at about <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/2} = 40\)</span>. Thus, the half-life is estimated at 25s.</li>
<li>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is therefore <span class="math inline">\(k\approx 0.693 / \mbox{half-life}) = - 0.63 / 25 = -0.0277\)</span>. Since we identified in Step 1 that exponential decay is involved, we expect <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to be negative. It is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>We know <span class="math inline">\(A \approx 25\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k \approx -0.0277\)</span>. We also now that for <span class="math inline">\(t=15\)</span> the function output is about <span class="math inline">\({\cal D} = 80^\circ\)</span>.</li>
<li>This means <span class="math inline">\(25^\circ + B e^{- 0.0277 \times 15} \approx 80^\circ = 25 + 0.66\ B\)</span>. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(B = (80 - 25)/0.66 = 83.3\)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4. Graph the function over the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Some cooks believe that food items cooked with wine or liquor will be non-alcoholic, because alcohol’s low boiling point causes it to evaporate quickly when heated. However, a study found that some of the alcohol remains: 25% after 1 hour of baking or simmering, and 10% after 2 hours.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modeler’s go-to function type for events like the evaporation of alcohol is exponential: The amount of alcohol that evaporates would, under constant conditions (e.g. an oven’s heat), be proportional to the amount of alcohol that hasn’t yet evaporated.</p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> A) Assume that 25% of the alcohol remains after 1 hour? If the process were exponential, how much would remain after 2 hours?</p>
<p>    10%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ That’s what the study is reported to have found, but that’s not consistent with an exponential process that decays to 25% after one hour </span>       25%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Exponentials decay to zero eventually, so don’t expect things to stay still after one hour. </span>       25% of 25%<span class="mcanswer"> Right! We know that 75% is eliminated over 1 hour, leaving 25%. The continuing exponential process will, over the next hour eliminate 75% of the amount at the start of that hour. So after hour 2 we’ll have 25% of the amount we had at hour 1, which was 25% of the original amount. </span>       75%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ That’s how much was eliminated in the first hour, not how much remains after 2 hours. </span>       75% of 75%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ In an exponential process, at any moment the rate of decay (e.g. 75% per hour) is a constant proportion of the amount that is still there. After one hour, there is 25% of the alcohol remaining. That will decay at a rate of 75% per hour. Over the next hour, we’ll lose 75% of the original 25%, giving us 25% of the original amount. </span></p>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> B) What is the half-life of an exponential process that decays to 25% after one hour?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>15 minutes<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ This provides time for four halvings in one hour, which would leave <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = 1/16\)</span> of the original not 1/4. </span><br>
</li>
<li>30 minutes<span class="mcanswer"> Correct. This gives time for two halvings in one hour, bringing us to 25% as observed. </span><br>

<p>Let’s change pace and think about the “10% after 2 hours” observation. First, recall that the amount left after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> halvings is
<span class="math inline">\(\mbox{amount_left}(n) \equiv \frac{1}{2}^n\)</span>
This is an exponential function with base 1/2.</p>
<p>You’re going to carry out a <strong><em>guess-and-check</em></strong> procedure to find a zero of the function <span class="math inline">\(\text{amount_left}(n) - 0.10\)</span> that is, you’ll find what <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> will generate the stated output value (e.g. 10%).
Open a sandbox and copy over the scaffolding, which include the definition of the <code>amount_left()</code> function. and a “guess” for the input. Change the guess until you get the output 10%.</p>

<p>Another way to find the input <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that generates an output of 10% is to construct the <strong><em>inverse function</em></strong> to <span class="math inline">\(\text{amount_left}()\)</span>.</p>

<p>We’re going to do something to make the graph more informative. (At least, more informative if you understand about logarithms and exponentials!)</p>
<p>Here’s the same graphic as above, but taking the <em>logarithm</em> of the number of cases (that is, <code>confirmed</code>) and of the number of deaths. Since we’re taking the logarithm of only the y-variable, this is called a “semi-log” plot.</p>

<p>Up through the beginning of March in the US, it is thought that most US cases were in people travelling into the US from hot spots such as China and Italy and the US, as opposed to contagion between people within the US. (Such contagion is called “community spread.”) So let’s focus on the data from the start of March onward.</p>
<p>Exponential growth appears as a straight-line pattern on a semi-log plot. Obviously, the overall pattern of the curves is not a straight line. The explanation for this is that the exponential growth rate changes over time, perhaps due to public health measures (like business closing, masks, etc.)</p>
<p>The first (official) US death from Covid-19 was recorded was recorded on Feb. 29, 2020. Five more deaths occurred two days later, bringing the cumulative number to 6.</p>
<p><strong>Question B</strong> The red data points for Feb 29/March 1 show up at zero on the vertical scale. The red data point for March 2 is at around 2 on the vertical scale. Is this consistent with the facts stated above?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>No. The data contradict the facts.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Think about what it means to be 0 on the vertical scale. </span><br>
</li>
<li>Yes. The vertical scale is in log units, so 0 corresponds to 1 death, since <span class="math inline">\(\ln 1 = 0\)</span>.<span class="mcanswer"> Excellent! </span><br>
</li>
<li>No. The vertical scale doesn’t mean anything.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ You can see from the plotting command what the quantity on the vertical axis is: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">log(confirmed)</a></code> for the blue dots and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">log(deaths)</a></code> for the red. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the purposes of making a semi-log plot is to enable you to compare very large numbers with very small numbers on the same graph. For instance, in the semi-log plot, you can easily see when the first death occurred, a fact that is invisible in the plot of the raw counts (the first plot in this exercise).</p>
<p>Another feature of semi-log plots is that they preserve proportionality. Look at the plot of raw counts and note that the curve for the number of deaths is much shallower than the curve for the number of (confirmed) cases. Yet on the semi-log plot, the two curves are practically parallel.</p>
<p>On a semi-log plot, the arithmetic difference between the two curves tells you what the proportion is between those curves. The parallel curves mean that the proportion is practically constant.
Calculate what the proportion between deaths and cases was in the month of May. Here’s a mathematical hint: <span class="math inline">\(\ln \frac{a}{b} == \ln a - \ln b\)</span>. We are interested in <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> What is the proportion of deaths to cases during the month of May?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>about 0.2%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Remember, it’s the natural logarithm that’s being plotted, so the inverse function is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">exp()</a></code>. </span><br>

<li>about 1%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ This would correspond to a (vertical) difference between the curves of about 4.6 log units. Is it really that big? </span><br>
</li>
<li>about 2%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ This would correspond to a (vertical) difference between the curves of about 4 log units. Is it really that big? </span><br>
</li>
<li>about 6%<span class="mcanswer"> Excellent! Good. You calculated <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">exp(log(deaths) - log(cases))</a></code> which gives an answer around 0.06, or 6%. </span><br>
</li>
<li>about 25%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ I’m not really sure what could lead you to this answer. You’re making a mistake that I didn’t anticipate. </span><br>
</li>
<li>more than 50%<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ It’s true that in May log(deaths) is about 12, and log(cases) is about 14, and 12/14 is indeed greater than 50%. But, on a log scale, the proportion relates to the difference between logs, not the ratio. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In many applications, people use semi-log plots to see whether a pattern is exponential or to compare very small and very large numbers. Often, people find it easier if the vertical scale is written in the original units rather than the log units. To accomplish both, the vertical scale can be ruled with raw units spaced logarithmically, like this:</p>

<p>It’s not too hard to see what’s going on. The tide rises and falls about every 12 hours. The difference between high tide and low tide is a little more than one meter. The tide gauge is calibrated so that a typical reading is 1 meter, although we don’t know what that is respect to. (Certainly not sea level, since then the typical reading would be around zero.)</p>
<p>This simple description tells almost everything needed to construct an A/B model of the tide level using a sinusoid, that is, a function of the form <span class="math display">\[A \sin(2\pi t/P) + B\]</span> The procedure is straightforward:</p>
<p><strong>Step 0</strong>: Determine whether a sinusoid model is appropriate. As you know, sinusoids oscillate up and down repeatedly with a steady <strong><em>period</em></strong>. That certainly seems the case here. But sinusoids are also steady in the <strong><em>peak</em></strong> and <strong><em>trough</em></strong> values for each cycle. That’s only approximately true in the Providence data. Models inevitably involve approximation. We’ll have to keep an eye on whether the <strong><em>fixed amplitude</em></strong> feature of sinusoids</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose a sensible value to represent the low point repeatedly reached. 0.5 m seems appropriate here, but obviously the exact position of the trough of each cycle varies over the 4.5 day duration of the data. Similarly, the peak is near 1.6 m. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the mean of the peak and trough values: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.6 + 0.5}{2} = 1.05\)</span> m here. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is half the difference between the peak and trough values: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.6 - 0.5}{2} = 0.55\)</span>. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is called the <strong><em>baseline</em></strong> of the sinusoid. Paramter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the <strong><em>amplitude</em></strong>. (Note that by convention, the amplitude is always <em>half</em> the high-to-low range of the sinusoid.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Estimate the period <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the sinusoid. This can be done with a ruler: the horizontal duration of a complete cycle. I like to use the time between peaks, but the time between troughs would work just as well. Another good choice is the time between positive sloping crossings of the baseline. (But be careful. The time between <em>successive</em> baseline crossings, one positive sloping and the other negative, give just <em>half</em> the period.)</p>
<p>On the scale of the above plot, it’s hard to read off the time of the first peak. So, zoom in until it becomes more obvious.</p>

<p>The reason why power-law functions have their important role in science have to do with the logic of physical quantities such as length, mass, time, area, volume, force, power, and so on. We’ll discuss this at length later in the course and the principles will appear throughout calculus.</p>
<p>As for finding the power law <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \equiv A x^p\)</span> that provides a good match to data, we’ll need some additional tools to be introduced in Chapter <a href="magnitudes.html#magnitudes">15</a>.</p>

<p>Our last two basic modeling functions express an important idea in modeling: <strong><em>localness</em></strong>. To put this in concrete terms, imagine creating a function to depict the elevation above sea level of a long road as a function of distance in miles, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, from the start of the road. If the road were level at 1200 feet elevation, a sensible model would be <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{elevation}(x) = 1200 \text{ft}\)</span>. If the road were gently sloping, a better model would be <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{elevation}(x) = 1200 + 3 x\)</span>. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="980" href="#980"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 980" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">980</span></span></p>
<p>Now let’s add a bump to the road. A bump is a local feature, often only a few feet wide. Or, perhaps the road is crossing a mountain range. That’s also a local feature, but unlike a bump in the road a mountain range extends for many miles.</p>
<p>The basic modeling function suited to represent bumps in the road, or potholes, or mountain ranges is generically called a “hump function.” In this book, we use a specific hump function called the <strong><em>gaussian</em></strong> function (<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">dnorm()</a></code>).</p>
<p>A gaussian function has two parameters: the location<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, the input value at which the function value is largest.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a> of the peak, which we’ll call the <strong><em>center</em></strong> parameter, and the sideways extent of the gaussian, which we’ll call the <strong><em>spread</em></strong>. Figure <a href="#fig:Fun-3C-1"><strong>??</strong></a> shows a few gaussian functions with different parameters.</p>
<p><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-1-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-1-2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-1-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>It’s easy to read off the <strong><em>center</em></strong> parameter from a graph of a gaussian. It’s the location of the top of the function graph. (We mentioned before that a mathematical word for “the location of the top” is <strong><em>argmax</em></strong>; the value for the input of the function that produces the maximum output.)</p>
<p>The <strong><em>spread</em></strong> parameter is also pretty straightforward, but you first have to become familiar with an unusual feature of the gaussian function. The output of the gaussian <em>far from the center</em> is practically zero. But it is not exactly zero. You can see from the graphs that the gaussian function has long flanks which approach zero output more or less in the manner of an exponential function. This means that we can’t measure the spread of the gaussian function by the distance between the zeros on either side of the peak. Instead, we need a <strong><em>convention</em></strong> that will allow us to be precise in quantifying what is admittedly a vague concept of width.</p>
<p>A simple convention is that the spread is the “half-width at half-height.” Come down half-way from the peak value of the output. Panel (c) of Figure <a href="#fig:Fun-3C-1"><strong>??</strong></a> marks that elevation with a thin, red, horizontal line. Along that line, measure the width of the gaussian, as marked by the thick red line in Panel (c). The <strong><em>spread</em></strong> parameter is half the width of the gaussian measured in this way. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="990" href="#990"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 990" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">990</span></span></p>
<p>If you have a keen eye, you’ll notice that the red line is not exactly half-way down from the peak. It’s down 39.35% from the peak. The official definition of width of a gaussian is not actually half-width at half-height. Instead, it is the length of the interval from the argmax to the inflection point.</p>
<p>Another seeming oddity about the gaussian function is the value of the maximum. It would have seemed natural to define this as 1, so-called “unit height.” The way it actually works is different: the maximum height is set so that the <strong><em>area</em></strong> under the gaussian function is 1.</p>
<p>This business with the area will make more sense when you’ve learned some calculus tools, specifically “differentation” and “integration.” For now though …</p>
<p>Consider another road feature, a local <strong><em>change</em></strong> from one elevation to another as you might accomplish with a ramp. The basic modeling function corresponding to a <strong><em>local change</em></strong> from one level to another is the <strong><em>sigmoid</em></strong> function. Figure <a href="#fig:Fun-3C-2"><strong>??</strong></a> shows three sigmoid functions.</p>
<p><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-2-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-2-2.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/Fun-3C-2-3.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
The name “sigmoid” comes from vague resemblance of the graph to the letter S (which is “sigma” in Greek: ς).</p>
<p>The parameters of the sigmoid function are the same as for the gaussian function: <strong><em>center</em></strong> and <strong><em>width</em></strong>. The center is easy to estimate from a graph. It’s the value of the input that produces an output of 0.5, half-way between the max and min of the sigmoid. As with the gaussian function, the <strong><em>width</em></strong> is measured according to a convention. The width is the <strong><em>change in input</em></strong> needed to go from an output of 0.5 to an output of 0.8413. This use of 0.8413 must seem loony at first exposure, but there is a reason. We’ll need more calculus tools before it can make sense.</p>
<p>Gaussian functions and sigmoid functions with the same center and width parameters have a very close relationship. The <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> of the sigmoid function is the corresponding <strong><em>gaussian</em></strong> function. Figures <a href="#fig:Fun-3C-1"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#fig:Fun-3C-2"><strong>??</strong></a> show corresponding gaussian and sigmoid functions. To the very far left, the sigmoid function is effectively flat: a slope near zero. Moving toward the center the sigmoid has a gentle slope: a low number. In the center, the sigmoid is steepest: a higher number. Then the slope of the sigmoid becomes gentle again before gradually falling off to zero. Near zero, then low, then higher, then low again, then falling off to zero: that’s also the description of a gaussian function!</p>
<p>In R, the name of the sigmoid function is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">pnorm()</a></code>. The gaussian is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">dnorm()</a></code>. The parameters that specify center and spread are named <code>mean</code> and <code>sd</code>. The word “mean” accurately conveys the idea of “center.” It would be nice to be able to say that <code>sd</code> comes from <code>s</code>prea<code>d</code>, but in fact <code>sd</code> is short for <strong><em>standard deviation</em></strong>, a old-fashioned term familiar to students of statistics. <span style="float: right; padding-left: 50px;"><a name="1000" href="#1000"><img src="www/icons8-signpost.png" title="Location: 1000" width="12px"></a><span style="color: red; font-size: 6pt;">1000</span></span></p>
<div class="why">
<p>“Standard deviation” is off-putting to many people and it really should be replaced with something less weird, perhaps <strong><em>typical spread</em></strong>. The “standard” can be interpreted as “widely used convention.” What about “deviation?” The gaussian function first appeared two-hundred years ago as part of a theory of measurement error. In the context of “error,” “deviation” might have made sense. But the theory of measurement error long ago became a more general theory of <strong><em>variation</em></strong>. Errors are just one source of variation.</p>

<p>Let’s develop the methodology for estimating the parameters of a sigmoid graphically.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sketch in a S-shaped curve that smoothly follows the data. In Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:true-sigmoid">8.9</a> this has already been done for you. For the Ebola data, you will have to use your judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the top plateau of the S-curve. This is indicated by the red line in Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:true-sigmoid">8.9</a>. The parameter <code>A</code> is simply the height of the plateau, in this case <span class="math inline">\(y \approx 15\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Come down half way from the plateau. Here, that’s 15/2 or 7.5, indicated by the horizontal blue line segment. Find the inverse of the S-curve from that half-way point onto the horizontal-axis. Here, that gives <span class="math inline">\(t \approx 5\)</span>. The parameter <code>center</code> is that value.</p></li>
<li><p>From the center of the S-shaped curve, follow the curve upward about 2/3 of the way to the plateau. In the diagram, that point is marked with a green line at <span class="math inline">\(t \approx 7\)</span>. The <code>width</code> is the distance along the horizontal axis from the blue centerline to the green line. Here, that’s <span class="math inline">\(7 - 5\)</span> giving 2 as the <code>width</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You might also want to trace the S-curve <em>downward</em> from the centerline about 2/3 of the way to zero. That’s indicated by the left green line. In the standard sigmoid, the two green lines will be equally spaced around the centerline. Of course the data may not be in the shape of the standard sigmoid, so you might find the two green lines are not equally spaced from the center.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>Put aside for the moment that the Ebola data doesn’t look exactly like the standard sigmoid function. Follow the above procedure, nevertheless.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question A</strong> Where is the top plateau?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>About Day 600.<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Measure the height of the plateau, not where it starts horizontally. </span><br>

<li>About 14,000 cases<span class="mcanswer"> Right-oh! </span><br>

<li>About 20,000 cases<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ Read the vertical axis markings more carefully. </span><br>
</li>
<li>None of the above<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ One of the above answers is pretty good. </span>

<p><strong>Question B</strong> Where is the centerline?</p>

<li>Near Day 200<span class="mcanswer"> Good. </span><br>
</li>
<li>Near Day 300<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ That’s the center of the vertical scale, not the day at which the curve reaches half-way to the eventual plateau. </span><br>
</li>
<li>At about 7000 cases<span class="mcanswer"> ︎✘ That’s half-way up to the plateau, but the answer you want is the day at which the curve reaches that point. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question C</strong> Now to find the <code>width</code> parameter. The curve looks more classically sigmoidal to the left of the centerline than to the right, so follow the curve <em>downward</em> as in Step 4 of the algorithm to find the parameters. What’s a good estimate for <code>width</code>?</p>

<p>I can’t predict what you see in your graph, since it depends on what starting estimates you used for <code>A</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>width</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Your task</strong>: <em>Write down the estimates you made by eye for <code>A</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>width</code>. Then explain in words any major systematic deviations of the ‘refined’ model from the data."</em></p>
<p>This idea of fitting a sigmoidal curve <em>globally</em> to data that are only roughly sigmoidal might be forgiven since it’s just a textbook exercise. But if this were a real-world problem, there are three rookie mistakes in the approach, despite its technical sophistication.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A model is built for a purpose. There’s no statement in the exercise about what the purpose is.</li>
<li>The data themselves are a good enough representation of the historical pattern. There’s no need to adorn them with a fitted curve.</li>
<li>The mathematical processes that would justify the expectation that a sigmoid curve could be useful are based on the idea that the underlying mechanism for the phenomenon is unchanging. For an epidemic, that mechanism is contagion. By saying the “mechanism is unchanging,” we mean that person-to-person transmission of the Ebola virus happens in the same way at the beginning of the epidemic as it does in the middle and in the end. But strong public health interventions were introduced to control the epidemic. That’s a change in mechanism.</li>
